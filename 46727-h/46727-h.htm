    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he history of
      medicine has been sadly neglected in our medical schools. The valuable and
      fruitful lessons which it tells of <i>what not to do</i> have been
      completely disregarded, and in consequence the same gross errors have over
      and over been repeated. The following pages represent an effort to bring
      the most important facts and events comprised within such history into the
      compass of a medical curriculum, and, at the same time, to rehearse them
      in such manner that the book may be useful and acceptable to the
      interested layman.,&mdash;i.e., to popularize the subject. This effort
      first took form in a series of lectures given in the Medical Department of
      the University of Buffalo. The subject-matter of these lectures has been
      rearranged, enlarged, and edited, in order to make it more presentable for
      easy reading and reference. I have also tried, so far as I could in such
      brief space, to indicate the relationship which has ever existed between
      medicine, philosophy, natural science, theology, and even <i>belles-lettres</i>.
      Particularly is the history of medicine inseparable from a consideration
      of the various notions and beliefs that have at times shaken the very
      foundation of Christendom and the Church, and for reasons which appear
      throughout the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of medicine is really a history of human error and of human
      discovery. During the past two thousand years it is hard to say which has
      prevailed. Notwithstanding, had it not been for the latter the total of
      the former would have been vastly greater. A large part of my effort has
      been devoted to considering the causes which conspired to prevent the more
      rapid development of our art. If among these the frowning or forbidding
      attitude of the Church figures most prominently, it must not be regarded
      as any expression of a quarrel with the Church of to-day. But let any one
      interested read President White's <i>History of the Warfare of Science
      with Theology</i>, the best presentation of the subject, and he can take
      no issue with my statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reverence for the true, the beautiful, and the good has characterized
      physicians in all times and climes. But little of the true, the beautiful,
      or the good crept into the transactions of the Church for many centuries,
      and we suffer, to-day, more from its interference in time past than from
      all other causes combined. The same may be said of theology, which is as
      separate from religion as darkness from light. Only when students of
      science emancipated themselves from the prejudices and superstitions of
      the theologians did medicine make more than barely perceptible progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this connection I would like to quote a paragraph from an article by
      King, in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> for 1893: "The difficulties under
      which medical science labored may be estimated from the fact that
      dissection was forbidden by the clergy of the Middle Ages on the ground
      that it was impious to mutilate a form made in the image of God. We do not
      find this pious objection interfering with such mutilation when effected
      by means of the rack and wheel and such other clerical, rather than
      medical, instruments."
    </p>
    <p>
      Written history is, to a certain extent at least, plagiarism; and I make
      no apology for having borrowed my facts from whatever source could best
      furnish them, but wish cheerfully and publicly to acknowledge my
      indebtedness to the works mentioned below, those especially of Renouard,
      Baas, and Sprengel, and to various biographical dictionaries. I have not
      even scrupled to take bodily sentences or expressions from these
      authorities, but have tried to so indicate them when I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer takes pleasure in acknowledging here the obligations which both
      he and the publishers feel to Dr. Joseph H. Hunt, of Brooklyn, N. Y., from
      whose extensive and valuable collection have been furnished the originals
      for most of the portraits in the following pages, and to Dr. F. P. Henry,
      Honorary Librarian of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, through
      whose courtesy was obtained the privilege of reproducing the illustrations
      of instruments and operations from some of the rare old works in the
      college library. The kind co-operation of these gentlemen has given a
      distinct and added value to the contents of this little work.

      class="pagenum">001</span><a name="link001" id="link001"></a> origin of
      medicine but little need be said by way of preface, save that it must have
      been nearly contemporaneous with the origin of civilization. The lower
      animals when sick or wounded instinctively lessen or alter their diet,
      seek seclusion and rest, and even in certain cases seek out some
      particular herb or healing substance. Thus, too, does the savage in his
      primitive state; and experience and superstition together have led nearly
      all the savage tribes into certain habits and forms in case of injury or
      disease. For us the history of medicine must necessarily begin with the
      written history of events, and its earliest endeavors need detain us but a
      very short time. Its earliest period is enveloped in profound obscurity,
      and so mingled with myth and table as to be very uncertain. It embraces an
      indefinite time, during which medicine was not a science, but an
      undigested collection of experimental notions,&mdash;vaguely described,
      disfigured by tradition, and often made inutile by superstition and
      ignorance. The earliest records of probable authenticity are perhaps to be
      met with in the Scriptures, from which may be gathered here and there a
      fair notion of Egyptian knowledge and practice. Thus we read that Joseph
      commanded his servants and physicians to embalm him, this being about 1700
      B.C.. It shows that Egypt at that time possessed a class of men who
      practiced the<span class="pagenum">002</span><a name="link002" id="link002"></a>
      healing art, and that they also embalmed the dead, which must have both
      required and furnished a crude idea of general anatomy. We are also
      informed from other sources that so superstitious were the Egyptians that
      they not only scoffed at, but would stone, the embalmers, for whom they
      had sent, after the completion of their task. The probably mythical being
      whom the Egyptians called Thoth, whom the Greeks named Hermes and the
      Latins Mercury, passed among the Egyptians as the inventor of all sciences
      and arts. To him are attributed an enormous number of writings concerning
      all subjects. Some have considered him as identical with Bacchus,
      Zoroaster, Osiris, Isis, Serapis, Apollo, and even Shem, the son of Xoah.
      Others have thought him to be a god. It is now almost certain that the
      books attributed to Hermes were not the work of anyone hand or of any one
      age. The-last six volumes of the forty-two composing the encyclopaedia,
      with which Hermes is credited, refer to medicine, and embrace a body of
      doctrines fairly complete and well arranged. Of these six, the first
      treats of anatomy; the second, of diseases; the third, of instruments; the
      fourth, of remedies; the fifth, of diseases of the eye; and the sixth, of
      diseases of women. In completeness and arrangement it rivals, if not
      surpasses, the Hippocratic collection, which it antedated by perhaps a
      thousand years. The Egyptians appear at first to have exposed their sick
      in public (at least, so says Strabo), so that if any of those who passed
      by had been similarly attacked they might give their advice for the
      benefit of the sufferers. In fact, according to Herodotus, the same custom
      prevailed among the Babylonians and Lusitanians. At a later date all who
      were thus cured were required to go to the temples and there inscribe
      their symptoms and what had helped them. The temples of Canopus and Vulcan
      at Memphis became the principal depots for these records, which were kept
      as carefully as were the archives of the nation, and were open for<span
      class="pagenum">003</span><a name="link003" id="link003"></a> public
      reference. These records, being under the control of the priests, were
      mainly studied by them, who later collected a great mass of facts of more
      or less importance, and endeavored to found upon the knowledge thus
      collected an exclusive practice of the art of medicine. In this way they
      formed their medical code, which was called by Diodorus the Hiera Sacra,
      <i>Sacred Book</i>, from whose directions they were never allowed to
      swerve. It was perhaps this code which was later attributed to Hermes, and
      that made up the collection spoken of by Clement of Alexandria. If in
      following these rules they could not save their patients they were held
      blameless, but were punished with death if any departure from them were
      not followed by success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have spoken of embalming as practiced by the Egyptians. It was of three
      grades: the first reserved for men of position and means, which cost one
      talent, and according to which the brain was removed by an opening through
      the nasal fossæ, and the intestines through an opening on the left side of
      the abdomen, after which both cavities were stuffed with spices and
      aromatics; then the body was washed and spread over with gum and wrapped
      in bandages of linen. The second grade was adopted by families of moderate
      means; and the third was resorted to by the poor, consisting simply in the
      washing of the body and maceration in lye for seventy days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pliny assures us that the kings of Egypt permitted the opening of corpses
      for the purpose of discovering the causes of disease, but this was only
      permitted by the Ptolemies, under whose reign anatomy was carried to a
      very high degree of cultivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medicine of the Hebrews is known generally through the Sacred
      Scriptures, especially through the writings attributed to Moses, which
      embraced rules of the highest sagacity, especially in public hygiene. The
      book of Leviticus<span class="pagenum">004</span><a name="link004"
      id="link004"></a> is largely made up of rules concerning matters of public
      health. In the eleventh chapter, for instance, meat of the rabbit and the
      hog is proscribed, as apparently injurious in the climate of Egypt and
      India; it, however, has been suggested that there was such variation of
      names or interpretation thereof as to make it possible that our rabbit and
      hog are not the animals alluded to by Moses. The twelfth and fifteenth
      chapters of the same book were designed to regulate the relation of man
      and wife and the purification of women, their outlines being still
      observed in some localities by certain sects, while the hygienic measure
      of circumcision then insisted upon is still observed as a religious rite
      among the descendants of Moses. For the prevention of the spread of
      leprosy, the measures suggested by Moses could not now be surpassed,
      although ancient authors have confounded under this name divers
      affections, probably including syphilis, to which, however, the same
      hygienic rules should apply. Next to Moses in medical lore should be
      mentioned Solomon, to whom is attributed a very high degree of knowledge
      of natural history, and who, Josephus claimed, had such perfect knowledge
      of the properties of all the productions of nature that he availed himself
      of it to compound remedies extremely useful, some of which had even the
      virtues necessary to cast out devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most conspicuous feature in the life of the Indian races is their
      division into castes, of which the most noble is that of the priests, or
      Brahmins, who in ancient times alone had the privilege of practicing
      medicine. Their Organon of Medicine, or collection of medical knowledge,
      was a hook which they called <i>Vagadasastir</i>. It was not
      systematically arranged, and in it demonology played a large rôle. They
      held the human body to consist of 100,000 parts, of which 17,000 were
      vessels, each one of which was composed of seven tubes, giving passage to
      ten species of gases, which by their conflicts engendered a number of
      diseases.<span class="pagenum">005</span><a name="link005" id="link005"></a>
      They placed the origin of the pulse in a reservoir located behind the
      umbilicus. This was four fingers wide by two long, and divided into 72,000
      canals, distributed to all parts of the body. The physician examined not
      only the pulse of his patient, but the dejecta, consulted the stars, the
      flight of birds, noted any incidental occurrence during his visits, and
      made up his prognosis from a multitude of varying circumstances, omitting
      only those which were really valuable, namely, the symptoms indicating the
      state of the organs. Ancient Hindoo charlatan priests let fall from the
      end of a straw a drop of oil into the patient's water. If the oil was
      precipitated and attached itself to the bottom of the vessel, they
      predicted an unfavorable result; if, on the contrary, it floated, they
      gave a favorable prognosis. This is, so far as we know, the earliest
      recorded way of testing the specific gravity of the urine.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all their absurdities, however, the Indians appear to have done some
      things that we scarcely do to-day: they arè said to have had an ointment
      that caused the cicatrices of variola to disappear, and they cured the
      bites of venomous serpents with remedies whose composition has been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The antiquity of the Chinese is simply lost in tradition and fable. From
      time immemorial their rulers have taken extraordinary care to prevent
      contact and interchange of ideas with foreigners. For 4000 years their
      manners, laws, religious beliefs, language, and territory have scarcely
      changed. In this respect they stand alone among the nations of the earth.
      They attribute the invention of medicine to one of their emperors named
      Hoam-ti, who was the third of the first dynasty, and whose supposititious
      date is 2687 B.C. He is considered to be the author of the work which
      still serves them as a medical guide. It is, however, more probably an
      apochryphal book. Its philosophy was of a sphygmic kind,&mdash;i.e., based
      upon the pulse, which they divided<span class="pagenum">006</span><a
      name="link006" id="link006"></a> into the supreme or celestial, the
      middle, and the inferior or terrestrial; by the examination of which the
      Chinese physician was supposed not only to show the seat of disease, but
      to judge of its duration and gravity. It is related that one of the
      ancient Chinese emperors directed the dead bodies of criminals to be
      opened, but this is questionable, since it is certain that they have the
      most profound ignorance of rudimentary anatomy, and glaring errors abound
      in their system. Being thus replete with errors, and possessing no
      anatomical knowledge, their surgery was of the most barbarous type. No one
      dared attempt a bloody operation; the reduction of hernia was unknown; a
      cataract was regarded as beyond their resources; and even venesection was
      never practiced. On the other hand, they employed cups, and acupuncture,
      fomentation, plasters of all kinds, lotions, and baths. The moxa, or
      red-hot button, was in constant use, and they had their magnetizers, who
      appear to have been convulsionists. For a long time there existed at Pekin
      an Imperial School of Medicine, but now there is no such organization nor
      any regulation for the privilege of practicing medicine or surgery since
      1792. At least until lately the country and the cities were infested with
      quacks, who dealt out poison and death with impunity. They practiced most
      murderous methods in place of the principles of midwifery. Only since the
      civilized missionaries have penetrated into their country has there been
      any improvement in this condition of affairs.
    </p>

      It is Greece which furnishes us with the most interesting and the most
      significant remains of the history of medicine during antiquity, as she
      furnishes every other art with the same historical advantages. During the
      period preceding the Trojan War there is little hut myth and tradition.
      Leclerc catalogued some thirty divinities, heroes or heroines, who were
      supposed to have invented or cultivated some of the branches of medicine.
      <i>Melampus</i> is perhaps<span class="pagenum">007</span><a name="link007"
      id="link007"></a> the first of these who immortalized himself by
      extraordinary cures, especially on the daughters of Proetus, King of
      Argos. These young princesses, having taken vows of celibacy, became
      subjects of hysterical monomania, with delusions, during which they
      imagined themselves transformed into cows and roamed the forests instead
      of the palaces. This nervous delusion spread to and involved many other
      women, and became a serious matter.

      Melampus, the shepherd, having observed the purgative effects upon goats
      of white hellebore, gave to the young women milk in which this plant had
      been steeped, thereby speedily effecting a cure. Scarcely less
      distinguished than Melampus was <i>Chiron</i>. He was mainly distinguished
      because he was the preceptor of <i>Æsculapius</i>, the most eminent of
      early Greeks in this field. By some Æsculapius was considered the son of
      Apollo by the nymph Coronis.

      cities of Greece contended for the honor of his birthplace, as they did
      for that of Homer. That he was famous at the time of the Argonautic
      expedition is seen by the fact that the twins Castor and Pollux desired
      him to accompany the expedition as surgeon. Be his origin what it may,
      Æsculapius was the leading character in medicine of all the ancients, with
      the possible exception of Hermes among the Egyptians; in fact, some
      scholars consider the two identical. Temples were erected in his honor,
      priests were consecrated to them, and schools of instruction were there
      established. It is related that Pluto, god of hell, alarmed at the
      diminishing number of his daily arrivals, complained to Jupiter, who
      destroyed the audacious healer&mdash;on which account, some wit has said,
      "the modern children of Æsculapius abstain from performing prodigies," But
      the true Æsculapians, the successors of the demigod, wrere imitated or
      copied by the crowd of charlatans and quacks, calling themselves
      theosophs, thaumaturgs, and so on, and not alone at that date, but for
      generations and centuries thereafter, Paracelsus and Mesmer being fair
      examples of this class. The poet Pindar, who lived seven or eight hundred
      years after Æsculapius, says that he cured ulcers, wounds, fever, and pain
      of all who applied to him by enchantment, potions, incisions, and by
      external applications. *

      The followers of Æsculapius, and the priests in the temples dedicated to
      him, soon formed a separate caste, transmitting from one to another, as a
      family heritage, their medical knowledge. At first no one was admitted to
      practice the sacred science unless lie joined the priesthood, although
      later this secrecy was relaxed. They initiated strangers, provided they
      fulfilled the test which they made. Some kind of medical instruction was
      given in each temple. The three most celebrated temples to Æsculapius were
      that of Rhodes, already extinct by the time of Hippocrates; that<span
      class="pagenum">009</span><a name="link009" id="link009"></a> of Cnidus,
      which published a small repertory; and finally that of Cos, most
      celebrated of all, because of the illustrious men who emanated from this
      school. In these temples votive tablets were fastened in large numbers,
      after the fashion of the Egyptians, the same giving the name of the
      patient, his affliction, and the manner of his cure. For example, such a
      one as this: "Julien vomited blood, and appeared lost beyond recovery. The
      oracle ordered him to take the pine-seeds from the altar, which they had
      three days mingled with honey; he did so, and was cured."

      Having solemnly thanked the god, he went away. There is reason to think
      that the priests of these temples made for their own uses much more minute
      and accurate accounts, which should be of some real service, since the
      writings which have come down to us evince a habit of close observation
      and clear description of disease. During the Trojan War<span
      class="pagenum">010</span><a name="link010" id="link010"></a> two men are
      frequently mentioned by Homer as possessing great surgical skill. These
      were <i>Machaon</i> and <i>Podalirius</i>. They were regarded as sons of
      Æsculapius, the former being the elder. The first account of venesection,
      although not authentic, refers to the bleeding practiced by the latter
      upon the daughter of the King of Caria, upon whose shores Podalirius was
      cast by tempest after the ruin of Priam's kingdom. Whether he was the
      first of all men to practice it or not, it is certain that the act of
      venesection goes back long prior to the era of Hippocrates, who speaks of
      it as frequently performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the deities upon Olympus seem at one time or another to have
      usurped medical functions. Apollo, the reputed father of Æsculapius,
      appropriated nearly everything under the name of Pæon, who assumed the
      privilege of exciting or subduing epidemics. Juno was supposed to preside
      at accouchements, and in both the Iliad and Odyssey it is indicated that
      Apollo was considered as the cause of all the natural deaths among men,
      and Diana of those among women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long Trojan War appears to have been an epoch-making event in the
      medical and surgical history of those times, as was the Civil War recently
      in our country. Certain vague and indefinite practices then took more
      fixed form, and from that time on medicine may be said to have been
      furnished with a history. After the dethronement of Priam and the
      destruction of his capital, navigation was free and unrestricted. The
      Hellenists covered with their colonies both shores of the Mediterranean,
      and their navigators even passed the pillars of Hercules. By these means
      the worship of Æsculapius passed from Greece into what is now Asia,
      Africa, and Italy. In his temple at Epidaurus was a statue of colossal
      size made of gold and ivory. The dialogues of Plato, especially the Phædo,
      make it apparent that the cock was the animal sacrificed to him, and hence
      sacred to the god of medicine. The priests attached to<span class="pagenum">011</span><a
      name="link011" id="link011"></a> his worship were called <i>Asclepiacloe</i>,
      or descendants of Æsculapius. The temples were usually hygienically
      located near thermal springs or fountains and among groves. Pilgrimages
      were made from all quarters, and these localities became veritable
      health-resorts. A well-regulated dietary, pure air, temperate habits, and
      faith stimulated to a fanatical degree combined and sufficed for cures
      which even nowadays would be regarded as wonderful. The priests prescribed
      venesection, purgatives, emetics, friction, sea-baths, and mineral waters,
      as they appeared to be indicated. The imagination of the patient was
      continually stimulated, and at the same time controlled. Before
      interrogating the oracles they must be purified by abstinence, prayer, and
      sacrifice. Sometimes they were obliged to lie in the temple for one or
      more nights. The gods sometimes revealed themselves in mysterious ways, at
      times devouring the cakes upon the altars under the guise of a serpent, or
      again causing dreams which were to be interpreted by^the priests. There
      can be no doubt that sometimes, at least, the grossest frauds and the
      basest trickery were relied upon for the purpose of impressing the minds
      of those weakened by abstinence or influenced by drugs. Mercenary
      considerations were not lacking; moreover, cures were often not obtained
      until zeal had been redoubled by largely increased contributions to the
      treasury of the temples. In the neighborhood of many of these temples
      serpents abounded, non-venomous and easily tamed. These were employed by
      the priests in various supernatural performances by which the ignorant
      people were astonished and profoundly impressed. In fact, the serpent and
      the serpent-myth played a very large rôle in the early history of medicine
      as well as that of religion and religious symbolism.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will thus be seen that during the space of about 700 years medicine
      underwent a transformation in Greece. It was first domestic and popular,
      practiced by shepherds, soldiers,<span class="pagenum">012</span><a
      name="link012" id="link012"></a> and others; then became sacerdotal; after
      the Trojan War it was confined to the vicinity of the temples and
      practiced in the name of some divinity; and finally it was wrapped in
      mystery and mystic symbolism, where superstition was played upon and
      credulity made to pay its reward. Down to the time of Hippocrates the
      Asclep-iadæ rendered some genuine service to science, especially by
      inculcating habits of observation, in which Hippocrates excelled above
      all. Later, however, down to the time of the Christian era, medicine in
      the temples declined, and became, in fact, a system based upon the
      grossest jugglery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is time now that we make a systematic attempt to classify events in the
      history of medicine, and to recognize certain distinct epochs as they have
      occurred. For this purpose I know of no better arrangement than that of
      Renouard, which, in the main, I shall follow, at least during the forepart
      of this book. In this sense he divides the past into three ages, known,
      respectively, as the <i>Age of Foundation, the Age of Transition, and the
      Age of Renovation</i>. Each of these chronological divisions is subdivided
      into periods, of which the first contains four:&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      AGE OF FOUNDATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. The <i>Primitive Period</i>, or that of <i>Instinct</i>, beginning with
      myth, and ending with the destruction of Troy 1184 years before Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The <i>Sacred, or Mystic, Period</i>, ending with the dispersion of the
      Pythagorean Society, 500 years before Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The <i>Philosophic Period</i>, terminating with the foundation of the
      Alexandrian library, 320 years before Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The <i>Anatomic Period</i>, ending with the death of Galen, about A.D.
      200.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND AGE, OR THAT OF TRANSITION, is divided into a fifth, or <i>Greek
      Period</i>, ending at the burning of the Alexandrian library, A.D. 640,
      and a sixth, <i>Arabic Period</i>, ending with the revival of letters,
      A.D. 1400.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE THIRD AGE, OR THAT OF RENOVATION,<span class="pagenum">013</span><a
      name="link013" id="link013"></a> includes the seventh, or <i>Erudite
      Period</i>, comprising the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and eighth,
      or <i>Reform Period</i>, comprising the seventeenth, eighteenth, and
      nineteenth centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examining this table for a moment, it will be seen that so far we have
      dealt with the Primitive Period and the Sacred, or Mystic, Period. Before
      passing on to the Philosophic Period let us for a moment follow Renouard,
      who likens the three schools of medical belief in the earlier part of the
      Primary Age, or the Age of Foundation, to the three schools of cosmogony,
      which obtained among the Greeks. The first of these was headed by
      Pythagoras, who regarded the universe as inhabited by acknowledged
      sentient principles which governed all substances in a determined way for
      preconceived purposes. Animals, plants, and even minerals were supposed to
      possess vivifying spirits, and above them all was a supreme principle. To
      this school corresponded the so-called Dogmatic School of medicine,
      attributed to Hippocrates, which was the precursor of modern vitalism, and
      regarded diseases as indivisible units from beginning to termination; in
      other words, they consisted of a regular programme of characteristic
      systems, successive periods, and of long course, either for the better or
      worse; that was one of the characteristic dogmas of the Hippocratic
      teaching. The Second System of cosmogony was that founded by Leucippus and
      Democritus, who explained all natural phenomena without recourse to the
      intervention of intelligent principles. All things for them existed as the
      necessary result of the eternal laws of matter. They denied preconceived
      purposes and ridiculed final causes. To this system corresponded that in
      medicine which has been termed <i>Methodism</i> (medically and literally
      speaking) and which recognized as its founders Æsculapius and Themison.
      The believers in this doctrine attempted to apply the atomic theory of
      Democritus and<span class="pagenum">014</span><a name="link014"
      id="link014"></a> Epicurus to the theory and practice of medicine. Atoms
      of various size were supposed to pass and repass without cessation through
      cavities or pores in the human body. So long as the atoms and pores
      maintained a normal relationship of size and proportion health was
      maintained, but it was deranged so soon as the exactness of these
      relations was destroyed or interfered with. The Dogmatists considered
      vital reaction as a primary phenomenon, while with the Methodists it was
      secondary. The Third System of cosmogony, founded by Parmenides and
      Pyrrho, believed in the natural improvement of bodies in their endless
      reproduction and change, and concluded that wisdom consisted in remaining
      in doubt; in other words, they were the agnostics of that day. "What is
      the use," said they, "of fatiguing the mind in endeavoring to comprehend
      what is beyond its capability." Later they were known as Skeptics and
      Zetetics, to indicate that they were always in search of truth without
      flattering them selves that they had found it. To them corresponded a
      third class of physicians, with Philinus and Serapis at their head, who
      deemed that proximate causes and primitive phenomena of disease were
      inaccessible to observation; that all that is affirmed on these subjects
      is purely hypothetical, and hence unworthy of consideration in choosing
      treatment. For them objective symptoms&mdash;or, as we would say, signs&mdash;constituted
      the natural history of disease, they thus believing that their remedies
      could only be suggested by experience, since nothing else could reveal
      itself to them. They therefore took the name of <i>Empirics</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally a fourth class of physicians arose who would not adopt any one of
      these systems exclusively, but chose from each what seemed to them most
      reasonable and satisfactory. They called themselves <i>Eclectics</i>,
      wishing thereby to imply that they made rational choice of what seemed
      best. The idea conveyed in the term "eclecticism" has been fairly
      criticised for this reason: eclecticism is in reality neither<span
      class="pagenum">015</span><a name="link015" id="link015"></a> a system nor
      a theory; it is individual pretension elevated to the dignity of dogma.
      The true eclectic recognizes no other rule than his particular taste,
      reason, or fancy, and two or more eclectics have little or nothing in
      common. If that were true two thousand years ago, it is not much less so
      to-day. The eclectic carefully avoids the discussion of principles, and
      has neither taste nor capacity for abstract reasoning, although he may be
      a good practitioner; not that he has no ideas, but that his ideas form no
      working system. With him medical tact&mdash;i.e., cultivated instinct&mdash;replaces
      principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eclectic of our day, however, is only an empiric in disguise,&mdash;that
      is, a man whose opinions are based on comparison of observed facts, but
      whose theoretical ideas do not go beyond phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      In older days philosophy embraced the whole of human knowledge, and the
      philosopher was not permitted to be unacquainted with any of its branches.
      Now physics, metaphysics, natural history, etc., are arranged into
      separate sciences, and the sum-total of knowledge is too great to be
      compassed by any one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pythagoras was the last of the Greek sages who made use of hieroglyphic
      writings and transmitted his doctrine in ancient language. Born at Samos,
      he was, first of all, an athlete; but one day, hearing a lecture no
      immortality of the soul, he was thereby so strongly attracted to
      philosophy that he renounced all other occupation to devote himself to it.
      He studied arduously in Egypt, in Phoenicia, in Chaldea, and even, it is
      said, in India, where he was initiated into the secrets of the Brahmins
      and Magi. Finally, returning to his own country, he was received by the
      tyrant Polycrates, but not made to feel at home. Starting on his travels
      again, he assisted at one of the Olympic games, and, being recognized, was
      warmly greeted. He sailed to the south of Italy, landed at Crotona, and
      lodged with Milo, the athlete. Commencing here<span class="pagenum">016</span><a
      name="link016" id="link016"></a> his lectures, he soon gathered around him
      a great number of disciples, of whom he required a very severe novitiate,
      lasting even five or six years, during which they had to abstain almost
      entirely from conversation, and live upon a very frugal diet. Those only
      who persevered were initiated later into the mysteries of the order. His
      disciples had for him most profound veneration, and were accustomed to
      decide all disputes witlr: "The master has said it." Pythagoras possessed
      immense knowledge; he invented the theorem of the square of the
      hypothenuse, and he first divided the year into 365 days and 6 hours. He
      seems to have suspected the movements of our planetary system. He traveled
      from place to place, and founded schools and communities wherever he went,
      which exercised, at least at first, only the happiest influence; but the
      success and influence which their learning gave them later made his
      disciples bold, and then dishonest, and his communities were finally
      dispersed by angry mobs, which forced their members to conceal or
      expatriate themselves; and so, even during the life-time of its founder,
      the Pythagorean Society was destroyed, and never reconstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Pythagoras and his disciples numbers played a very important rôle,
      and the so-called language of numbers was first taught by him. He
      considered the unit as the essential principle of all things, and
      designated God by the figure 1 and matter by the figure 2, and then he
      expressed the universe by 12, as representing the juxtaposition of 1 and
      2. As 12 results from multiplying 3 by 4, he conceived the universe as
      composed of three distinct worlds, each of which was developed in four
      concentric spheres, and these spheres corresponded to the primitive
      elements of fire, air, earth, and water. The application of the number 12
      to express the universe Pythagoras had received from the Chaldeans and
      Egyptians&mdash;it being the origin of the institution of the zodiac.
      Although this is digressing, it serves to show what enormous importance
      the people of that<span class="pagenum">017</span><a name="link017"
      id="link017"></a> time attached to numbers, especially to the ternary and
      quarternary periods in the determination of critical days in illness.
      Pythagoras was the founder of a philosophic system of great grandeur,
      beauty, and, in one sense, completion, embracing, as it does, and uniting
      by common bounds God, the universe, time, and eternity; furnishing an
      explanation of all natural phenomena, which, if not true, was at that time
      acceptable, and which appears in strong and favorable contrast as against
      the mythological systems of pagan priests. No wonder that it captivated
      the imagination and understanding of the thinking young men of that day.
      Had they continued in the original purity of life and thought in which he
      indoctrinated them there is no knowing how long the Pythagorean school
      might have continued. But after it had been dissolved by the storm of
      persecution, its members were scattered all over Greece and even beyond.
      Now no longer held by any bonds, many of them revealed the secrets of
      their doctrine, to which circumstance we owe the little knowledge thereof
      we now possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pythagoreans apparently first introduced the custom of visiting
      patients in their own homes, and they went from city to city and house to
      house in performance of this duty. On this account they were called
      Periodic or Ambulant physicians, in opposition to the Asclepiadæ, who
      prescribed only in the temples. Empedocles, of Agrigentum, well known in
      the history of philosophy, was perhaps the most famous of these
      physicians. Let the following incident witness his sagacity: Pestilential
      fevers periodically ravaged his native city. He observed that their
      appearance coincided with the return of the sirocco, which blows in Sicily
      on its western side. He therefore advised to close by a wall, as by a dam,
      the narrow gorge from which this wind blew upon Agrigentum. His advice was
      followed and his city was made free from the pestilence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the inhabitants of Selinus were ravaged by epidemic<span
      class="pagenum">018</span><a name="link018" id="link018"></a> disease. A
      sluggish stream filled the city with stagnant water from which mephitic
      vapors arose. Empedocles caused two small rivulets to be conducted into
      it, which made its current more rapid; the noxious vapors dispersed and
      the scourge subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Gymnasia</i>.&mdash;Before we proceed to a somewhat more detailed,
      but brief, account of Hippocrates, it is necessary to say a word or two of
      the ancient gymnasia of Greece, which were used long before the Asclepiadæ
      had practiced or begun to teach. In these gymnasia were three orders of
      physicians: first, the director, called the Gym-nasiarch; second, the
      subdirector, or Gymnast, who directed the pharmaceutical treatment of the
      sick; and, lastly, the Iatroliptes, who put up prescriptions, anointed,
      bled, gave massage, dressed wounds and ulcers, reduced dislocations,
      treated abscesses, etc. Of the gymnasiarclis wonderful stories are told
      evincing their sagacity, which, though somewhat fabulous, indicate the
      possession of a very high degree of skill of a certain kind. Of one of the
      most celebrated of these, Herodicus, we may recall Plato's accusation, who
      reprimanded him severely for succeeding too well in prolonging the lives
      of the aged. Whatever else may be said, we must acknowledge that above all
      others the Greeks recognized the value of physical culture in the
      prevention of infirmity, and of all physical methods in the treatment of
      disease. By their wise enactments with reference to these matters they set
      an example which modern legislators have rarely, if ever, been wise enough
      to follow,&mdash;an example of compulsory physical training for the young,&mdash;and
      thereby built up a nation of athletes and a people of rugged constitution
      among whom disease was almost unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      I come now to the so-called <i>Philosophic Period</i>, or the third period
      in the Age of Foundation, which is inseparably connected with the name of
      <i>Hippocrates</i>. This central figure in the history of ancient medicine
      was born on the Island<span class="pagenum">019</span><a name="link019"
      id="link019"></a> of Cos, of a family in which the practice of medicine
      was hereditary, who traced their ancestors on the male side to Æsculapius,
      and on the female side to Hercules. The individual to whom every one
      refers under this name was the second of seven; the date of his birth goes
      back to 460 B.C., but of his life and his age at death we do not know;
      some say he lived to be over one hundred years of age. It is certain that
      he traveled widely, since his writings evince the knowledge thus gained.
      He was a contemporary of Socrates, although somewhat younger, and lived in
      the age of Pericles,&mdash;the golden age for science and art in Greece.

    <p>
      The Island of Cos is now called Stan-Co, and is situated not far from the
      coast of Ionia. Formerly it was considered as having a most salubrious
      climate; now that it is under the dominion of the Turks, it is considered
      most unhealthy. It possessed a temple dedicated to Æsculapius and<span
      class="pagenum">020</span><a name="link020" id="link020"></a> a celebrated
      medical school. But Hippocrates, not satisfied with what he could learn
      here, visited the principal foreign cities, and seems to have been a most
      accurate and painstaking observer and collector of notes. That he achieved
      great renown in his life is known, since Plato and even Aristotle refer to
      him as their authority in very many matters. His children and
      grandchildren followed in his footsteps, and published their writings
      under the same name; it has, therefore, become difficult to distinguish
      his works from theirs. Finally, authors more unscrupulous, who bore no
      relationship to him, attached his name to their own writings. But the true
      were, as a rule, easily distinguished from the spurious, and were
      carefully separated by those in charge of the Alexandrian library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enumeration of his writings by different authors varies very much.
      Renouard, who seems to have studied the subject very carefully, gives the
      following as appearing to him to be the authentic list of writings of
      Hippocrates the Second,&mdash;i.e., the Great: The <i>Prognostic</i>, the
      <i>Aphorisms</i>, the first and third books of <i>Epidemics</i>, that on
      <i>Regimen in Acute Disease</i>, that on <i>Airs, Waters, and Places, that
      on Articulations and Luxations</i>, that on <i>Fractures</i>, and the <i>Mochlic</i>,
      or the treatise on instruments and reduction. This list does not comprise
      the fourth part of the entire Hippocratic collection, but its authenticity
      appears to be undoubted, and it suffices, as Renouard says, to justify the
      enthusiasm of his contemporaries and the admiration of posterity. Later,
      joined with the writings of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and others, they
      constituted the so-called <i>Hippocratic collection</i>, which was a
      definite part of the great libraries of Alexandria and Pergamos, and
      formed the most ancient authentic monument of medical science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respect for the bodies of the dead was a religious observance in all
      Greece, and prevented the dissection of the human body. Consequently the
      knowledge of anatomy possessed by Hippocrates must have been meagre.
      Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum">021</span><a name="link021" id="link021"></a>
      he described lesions, like wounds of the head, of the heart, the glands,
      the nature of bones, etc. It being impossible to establish a physiology
      without an anatomical basis, it is not strange that we find but little
      physiology in the Hippocratic writings, and that this little is very crude
      and incorrect. Arteries and veins were confounded, and nerves, tendons,
      ligaments, and membranes were represented as analogous or interchangeable
      tissues. The physiologists of those days abandoned themselves to
      transcendental speculation concerning the nature and principles of life,
      which some placed in moisture, others in fire, etc. Speculation, thus run
      wild, prevented such accurate observation as might have greatly enhanced
      the progress of physiological knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippocrates wrote at least three treatises concerning hygiene: The first,
      on <i>Airs, Waters, and Places</i>; the second, on <i>Regimen</i>; the
      third, on <i>Salubrious Diet</i>,&mdash;practically an abridgement of the
      preceding, in which he recommends the habit of taking one or two vomits
      systematically every month. The classification of diseases into internal
      or medical, and external or surgical, is not modern, but is due to
      Hippocrates; neither is it philosophic, although it is very convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      With so little knowledge of physiology and pathology as the ancients had,
      it is not strange that they ascribed undue importance to external
      appearance; in other words, to what has been termed <i>semeiotics</i>,
      which occupies a very considerable place in the medical treatises of the
      Asclep-iadæ. Indeed, the writings on this subject constitute more than
      one-eighth part of the entire Hippocratic collection. To prognosis, also,
      Hippocrates ascribed very great importance, saying that "The best
      physician is the one who is able to establish a prognosis, penetrating and
      exposing first of all, at the bedside, the present, the past, and the
      future of his patients, and adding what they omit in their statements. He
      gains their confidence, and being convinced<span class="pagenum">022</span><a
      name="link022" id="link022"></a> of his superiority of knowledge they do
      not hesitate to commit themselves entirely into his hands. He can treat,
      also, so much better their present condition in proportion as he shall be
      able from it to foresee the future," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the careful scrutiny of facial appearances, the position, and other
      body-marks about the patient he attributed very great importance; in fact,
      so positive was he about these matters that he embodied the principal
      rules of semeiotics into aphorisms, to which, however, there came later so
      many exceptions that they lost much of their value. From certain passages
      in his book on <i>Prediction</i>, and from the book on <i>Treatment</i>,
      which is a part of the Hippocratic collection, it appears that it was the
      custom then of physicians to announce the probable issue of the disease
      upon the first or second visit,&mdash;a custom which still prevails in
      China and in Turkey, It gave the medical man the dignity of an oracle when
      right, but left him in a very awkward position when wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Hippocrates we are indebted for the classification of sporadic,
      epidemic, and endemic forms, as well as for the division of disease into
      acute and chronic. Hippocrates wrote extensively on internal disease,
      including some particular forms of it, such as epilepsy, which was called
      the sacred disease; also fragments on diseases of girls, relating
      particularly to hysteria; also a book on the nature of woman, an extensive
      treatise on diseases of women, and a monograph on sterility. That
      Hippocrates was a remarkably close observer of disease as it appeared to
      him his books amply prove; in fact, they almost make one think that close
      observation is one of the lost arts, being only open to the objection that
      too much weight was attached to insignificant external appearances,
      speculation on which detracted from consideration of the serious feature
      of the case. His therapeutics, considering the crude information of the
      time, was a vast improvement on that which had preceded,<span
      class="pagenum">023</span><a name="link023" id="link023"></a> and really
      entitled him to his title of "Great Physician."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of external diseases and their surgical therapeutics he wrote fully: on <i>The
      Laboratory of the Surgeon</i>, dealing with dressings, bandaging, and
      operating; on <i>Fractures</i>; and on <i>Articulations and Dislocations</i>;
      showing much more anatomical knowledge than was possessed by his
      contemporaries. The <i>Mochlic</i> was an abridgment of former treatises;
      in <i>Wounds of the Head</i> he formulated the dictum concerning the
      possible danger of trifling wounds and the possible recovery from those
      most serious, so often ascribed to Sir Astlev Cooper. Other monographs,
      also, he wrote, on <i>Diseases of the Eye</i>, on <i>Fistula</i>, and on
      <i>Hoemorrhoids</i>. He described only a small number of operations,
      however, and all the Hippocratic writings on surgery would make but a very
      incomplete treatise as compared with those that belong to the next
      historical epoch; all of which we have to ascribe&mdash;in the main&mdash;to
      prejudice against dissection and ignorance of anatomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the earliest times physicians and writers occupied themselves largely
      with obstetrics, as was most natural. The Hippocratic collection includes
      monographs on <i>Generation; the Nature of the Infant; the Seventh Month
      of Pregnancy; the Eighth Month of Pregnancy; on Accouchement;
      Superfoetation; on Dentition; on Diseases of Women; on Extraction of the
      Dead Foetus</i>. The treatise on superfcetation concerned itself mainly
      with obstetrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      On epidemics Hippocrates writes extensively, showing that he had studied
      them carefully. He was among the first to connect meteorological phenomena
      with those of disease during given seasons of the year, expressing the
      hope that by the study of storms it would be possible to foresee the
      advent of the latter, and prepare for them. Seven books of the Hippocratic
      collection bear the title of <i>Epidemics</i>, although only two of them
      are exclusively devoted to this subject. In these books were contained a
      long<span class="pagenum">024</span><a name="link024" id="link024"></a>
      list of clinical observations relating to various diseases. They
      constituted really a clinical study of disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collection of Hippocrates's <i>Aphorisms</i> fills seven of the books;
      no medical work of antiquity can compare with these. Physicians and
      philosophers of many centuries have professed for them the same veneration
      as the Pythagoreans manifested for their golden verses. They were
      considered the crowning glory of the collection. Even within a short time
      past the Faculty of Paris required aspirants for the medical degree to
      insert a certain number of these in their theses, and only the political
      revolution of France served to cause a discontinuance of this custom.
      These aphorisms formed, says Littré, "a succession of propositions in
      juxtaposition, but not united." It has always been and always will be
      disadvantageous for a work to be written in that style, since such
      aphorisms lose all their general significance; and that which seems
      isolated in itself becomes more so when introduced into modern science,
      with which it has but little practical relationship. But not so if the
      mind conceive of the ideas which prevailed when these aphorisms were
      written; in this light, when they seem most disjoined they are most
      related to a common doctrine by which they are united, and in this view
      they no longer appear as detached sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The school of the Asclepiadæ has been responsible for certain theories
      which have been more or less prominent during the earlier historical days.
      One of these which prevailed throughout the Hippocratic works is that of
      <i>Coction and Crisis</i>. By the former term is meant thickening or
      elaboration of the humors in the body, which was supposed to be necessary
      for their elimination in some tangible form. Disease was regarded as an
      association of phenomena resulting from efforts made by the conservative
      principles of life to effect a coction,&mdash;i.e., a combination of the
      morbific matter in the economy, it being held that the latter could not be
      properly expelled until thus united and prepared<span class="pagenum">025</span><a
      name="link025" id="link025"></a> so as to form excrementitious material.
      This elaboration was supposed to be brought about by the vital principles,
      which some called nature (<i>Physis</i>), some spirit (<i>Psyche</i>),
      some breath (<i>Pneuma</i>), and some heat (<i>Thermon</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The gradual climax of morbid phenomena has, since the days of Hippocrates,
      been commonly known as <i>Crisis</i>; it was regarded as the announcement
      of the completion of the union by coction. The day on which it was
      accomplished was termed <i>critical</i>, as were also the signs which
      preceded or accompanied it, and for the crisis the physician anxiously
      watched. Coction having been effected and crisis occurring, it only
      remained to evacuate the morbific material&mdash;which nature sometimes
      spontaneously accomplished by the critical sweat, urination, or stools, or
      sometimes the physician had to come to her relief by the administration of
      diuretics, purgatives, etc. The term "critical period" was given to the
      number of days necessary for coction, which in its perfection was supposed
      to be four, the so-called quarternary, while the septenary was also held
      in high consideration. Combination of figures after the Pythagorean
      fashion produced many complicated periods, however, and so periods of 34,
      40, and 60 days were common. This doctrine of crisis in disease left an
      impress upon the medical mind not yet fully eliminated. Celsus was the
      most illustrious of its adherents, but it can be recognized plainly in the
      teachings of Galen, Sydenham, Stahl, Van Swieten, and many others. In
      explanation, it must be said that there have always existed diseases of
      nearly constant periods, these being nearly all of the infectious form,
      and that the whole "critical" doctrine is founded upon the recognition of
      this natural phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hippocratic books are full, also, of the four elements,&mdash;earth,
      water, air, and fire; four elementary qualities,&mdash;namely, heat, cold,
      dryness, and moisture; and the four cardinal humors,&mdash;blood, bile,
      atrabile, and phlegm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing<span class="pagenum">026</span><a name="link026" id="link026"></a>
      to the poverty of knowledge of physics and chemistry possessed by the
      ancients, and notwithstanding their errors and imperfections, the doctrine
      of Dogmatism, founded upon the theory of coction and humors, was the most
      intelligible and complete among the medical doctrines of antiquity,
      responding better, as it did, to the demands of the science of that day.
      That Hippocrates was a profound observer is shown in this: that he reminds
      both philosophers and physicians that the nature of man cannot be well
      known without the aid of medical observation, and that nothing should be
      affirmed concerning that nature until by our senses we have become certain
      of it. In this maxim he took position opposed to the Pythagorean doctrine,
      and included therein the germ of a new philosophy of which Plato
      misconceived, and of which Aristotle had a very faint glimpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another prominent theory throughout the Hippocratic books is that of
      Fluxions, meaning thereby about what we would call congestions, or
      conditions which we would say were ordinarily caused by cold, though
      certain fluxions were supposed to be caused by heat, because the tissues
      thereby became rarefied, their pores enlarged, and their humor attenuated
      so that it flowed easily when compressed. The whole theorv of fluxion was
      founded on the densest ignorance of tissues and the laws of physics, the
      body of man being sometimes likened to a sponge and sometimes to a sieve.
      The treatment recommended was almost as crazy as the theory. Certain other
      theories have complicated or disfigured the Hippocratic writings, and
      certain have been founded on the consideration of two elements&mdash;i.e.,
      fire and earth&mdash;or on the consideration of one single element which
      was supposed to be air,&mdash;the breath, or <i>pneuma</i>; and there was&mdash;lastly&mdash;the
      theory of any <i>excedent</i>, which is very vague; of all of these we may
      say that they are not of sufficient interest to demand expenditure of our
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eclat<span class="pagenum">027</span><a name="link027" id="link027"></a>
      which the second (i.e., the Great) Hippocrates gave to the school of
      Asclepiadæ in the Island of Cos long survived, and many members of his
      family followed in his footsteps. Among his most prominent successors were
      <i>Polybius, Diodes, and Praxagoras</i>, also of Cos,&mdash;the last of
      the Asclepiadæ mentioned in history. Praxagoras was distinguished
      principally for his anatomical knowledge; like Aristotle, he supposed that
      the veins originated from the heart, but did not confound these vessels
      with the arteries, as his predecessors had done, but supposed that they
      contained only air, or the vital spirit. It has been claimed that he
      dissected the human body. He laid the foundation of sphygmology, or study
      of the pulse, since Hippocratic writers rarely alluded to arterial
      pulsations and described them as of only secondary importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The predominating theory in the Island of Cos was that which made health
      dependent on the exact proportion and play of the elements of the body,
      and on perfect combination of the four cardinal humors. This was the
      prevailing doctrine,&mdash;i.e., the Ancient Medical Dogmatism, so named
      because it embraced the most profound dogmas in medicine, and was taught
      exclusively until the foundation of the school at Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men, however, more commonly ranked among philosophers than among
      physicians of antiquity, dissected the statements of Hippocrates, and
      embodied them more or less in their own teachings, and thus exercised a
      great influence on the progress of the human mind, particularly in the
      direction of medical study. The first of these was Plato, profound
      moralist, eloquent writer, and most versatile thinker of his day or any
      other. He undertook the study of disease, not by observation (the
      empirical or experimental method), but by pure intuition. He seemed to
      have never discovered that his meditations were taken in the wrong
      direction, and that the method did not conduce to the discovery of
      abstract truths. He gave beauty an abstract<span class="pagenum">028</span><a
      name="link028" id="link028"></a> existence, and affirmed that all things
      beautiful are beautiful because of the presence of beauty. This reminds
      one of that famous response in the school of the Middle Ages to a
      question: "Why does opium produce sleep?" the answer being: "Because it
      possesses the sleepy principle." Plato introduced into natural science a
      doctrine of final causes. He borrowed from Pythagoras the dogma of
      homogeneity of matter, and claimed that it had a triangular form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Aristotle</i>, equally great thinker with Plato, but whose mental
      activity was manifest in other channels, was born in Stagyrus, in
      Macedonia. He was fascinated by the teachings of Plato, and attained such
      eminence as a student that King Philip of Macedon made him preceptor to
      his son Alexander, subsequently the Great, by whom he was later furnished
      with sufficient funds to form the first known museum in natural history.&mdash;a
      collection of rare objects of every sort, transmitted, many of them, by
      the royal hands of his former student from the remote depths of Asia.
      Aristotle, by long odds the greatest naturalist of antiquity, laid the
      first philosophic basis for empiricism. He admitted four elements&mdash;fire,
      air, earth, and water&mdash;and believed them susceptible of mutual
      transmutation. He studied the nature of the soul and that of the animal
      body; regarded heat and moisture as two conditions indispensable to life;
      described the brain with some accuracy, but without the least idea of its
      true function; said that the nerves proceeded from the heart; termed the
      aorta a nervous vein; and made various other mistakes which to us seem
      inexcusable. Nevertheless, he was rich in many merits, and no one of his
      age studied or searched more things than he, nor introduced so many new
      facts. Although he never dissected human bodies, he nevertheless corrected
      errors in anatomy held to by the Hippocratic school. He dissected a large
      number of animals of every species, and noted the varieties of size and
      shape of hearts of various animals and birds. In<span class="pagenum">029</span><a
      name="link029" id="link029"></a> other words, he created a comparative
      anatomy and physiology, and the plan that he traced was so complete that
      two thousand years later the great French naturalist Cuvier followed it
      quite closely. If he be charged with having propagated a taste for
      scholastic subtleties, he also furnished an example of patient and
      attentive observation of Nature. His history of animals is a storehouse of
      knowledge, and his disciples cultivated with zeal anatomy, physiology, and
      natural history. His successor, Theophrastus, was the most eminent
      botanist of antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will thus be seen that Plato and Aristotle were the eminent propagators
      of two antagonistic opinions. One supposed knowledge to be derived by
      mental intuition, and the other that all ideas are due to sensation. Both
      count among moderns some partisans of the greatest acumen: Descartes,
      Leibnitz, and Kant being followers of Plato, and Bacon, Locke, Hume, and
      Condillac, of Aristotle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excuse for stating these things, which apparently do not so closely
      concern the history of medicine, must be that of the learned interpreter
      of the doctrine of Cuvier, that "The first question in science is always a
      question of method."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippocrates formed a transition between a period of mythology and that of
      history. His doctrine was received by contemporaries and by posterity with
      a veneration akin to worship. No other man ever obtained homage so
      elevated, constant, and universal. A little later ignorance reigned in the
      school that he made celebrated. Methods and theories were propagated there
      under the shadow of his name which he would have disowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical science now changes its habitation as well as its aspect, and from
      the record of Hippocrates and his work we turn to the fourth period of the
      Age of Foundation,&mdash;namely, the <i>Anatomic</i>, which extends from
      the foundation of the Alexandrian library, 320 B.C., up to the death of
      Galen, about the year A.D. 200.

      Period.&mdash;As already seen, Alexander the Great and his successors
      collected the intellectual and natural riches of the universe, as they
      knew them, and placed them at the disposal of studious men to benefit
      humanity; their complete value has not yet been exhausted, and never can
      be. This undertaking was carried out under conditions that made it one of
      extreme difficulty. Manuscripts were then rare and most costly; but few
      copies of a given work were in existence, often only one, and these were
      held almost priceless. Under these circumstances the establishment of a
      public library and of a museum was an act of philanthropy and liberality
      simply beyond eulogy, and did more to immortalize the founder of the
      collection than all his victories and other achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
      This appears to have also occurred to two of Alexander's lieutenants&mdash;one
      Eumenes, Governor of Pergamos, and the other, Ptolemy, Governor of Egypt.
      After the death of the conqueror his generals shook of all dependence upon
      the central government, and endeavored to centralize their own authority.
      But these two were the only ones among so many leaders who did not devote
      all their attention to armies and invasion, but interested themselves in
      commerce and arts. So active were they in the enterprise that Eumenes had
      gathered two hundred thousand volumes for the library at Pergamos, and
      Ptolemy six to seven hundred thousand for that of Alexandria. The latter
      was divided<span class="pagenum">031</span><a name="link031" id="link031"></a>
      into two parts, the greater and the lesser, the latter of which was kept
      in the temple of Serapis, hence known as the <i>Serapium</i>. These
      notable efforts to found enormous collections first excited praiseworthy
      rivalry among contemporaries and rulers, which, however, degenerated into
      contemptible jealousy, so that some of the rulers of Alexandria even went
      so far as to interdict the exportation of papyrus, in order to prevent the
      making of copies for the library of Pergamos. But the effect was
      unexpected, since it led to the invention of the paper of Pergamos,
      otherwise called parchment, which completely displaced the bark from which
      papyri were made. Be this as it was, the collection at Alexandria had a
      much more marked influence on the medical study of the future than that of
      Pergamos, and calls for our particular notice. About it sprang up first a
      collection of learned men, and then the inevitable result&mdash;a school
      of learning. It was Ptolemy Soter who called around him the most renowned
      men of his day. He provided them with homes adjoining the library, endowed
      them with salaries, and charged them with the classification and collation
      of manuscripts, or with the giving of instruction by lectures and
      discussions. Ptolemy himself sometimes took part in these feasts of
      reason, which became still more frequent and formal under his son Ptolemy
      Philadelphia. These were called the Feasts of the Muses and of Apollo,&mdash;<i>i.e.,
      ludi musarum</i>,&mdash;and, consequently, the place where they were held
      came to be termed the "<i>museum</i>." Often the subjects for discussion
      were announced in advance, and those who gained the most applause received
      rewards in accordance with the merits of their work. Among those who
      enjoyed these advantages under the reign of these two Ptolemies are
      prominently named two physicians, Herophilus and Erasistratus, the latter
      said to be the grandson of Aristotle. It was under this Philadelphus that
      the Hebrew wise men translated into Greek the Holy Scriptures, which
      translation has since<span class="pagenum">032</span><a name="link032"
      id="link032"></a> been called the Septuagint&mdash;so called because it is
      supposed to have been translated by the members of the Sanhedrim, which
      was composed of about seventy men, or because, according to another
      legend, it was translated by seventy-two men in seventy-two hours. These
      <i>savants</i> of ancient Egypt, thus supported by the dynasty of the
      Lagides, gave the first place to the science of medicine. As regards this
      study, the school of Alexandria eclipsed almost from its origin the
      ancient schools of Cos and Pergamos, and during its existence was the
      leading institution of its kind in the world. At the time of Galen it was
      sufficient to have studied there, and even to have resided a short time in
      Alexandria, to obtain the reputation of being a physician. Nearly all the
      scholars of these five centuries had received instruction in this school.
      The principal reason for its eminence in medical instruction was the
      practice of dissection of human bodies, which, under the Ptolemies, was
      allowed and recommended, and by which the science of medicine received an
      extraordinary impulse. Although the prejudice of Egyptians was very strong
      against those who touched a dead body, the Ptolemies themselves are said
      to have participated in this kind of anatomical study, thus destroying by
      their example the odium previously attached to dissection. Strange to say,
      however, the practice of dissection fell into disuse toward the end of
      this Anatomic Period, and scholars preferred to indulge in subtle
      metaphysical discussions rather than study human tissues. But the
      principal reason for giving up this practice was the Roman domination of
      Egypt, the Romans, inconsistently, being perfectly willing to see any
      amount of bloodshed in the arena, and all sorts of inhumanities practiced
      upon living human beings, but holding that contact with a corpse was
      profanation; so that not a single anatomist of reputation had his origin
      in ancient Rome. "If on any occasion," says Renouard, "a foreign physician
      attached to the king or general desired to avail himself of the occasions<span
      class="pagenum">033</span><a name="link033" id="link033"></a> that were
      afforded to examine the structures of the internal parts of the human
      body, he was obliged to conceal and carry off during the night some body
      abandoned to the birds of prey." To complete the melancholy termination of
      the Anatomic Period, the labors of the writers of those days were all lost
      by the burning of the great library by Julius Cæsar, which was the
      beginning of the chain of disasters with which Egypt was accursed under
      Roman dominion. Although Mark Antony, induced thereto by the endearments
      and solicitations of Cleopatra, transported the library of Pergamos to
      Alexandria, even this was unavailing to restore the position of the
      school, since the atrocious and imbecile Caracalla took from the
      pensioners of the museum their privileges of common residence and every
      other advantage, and suppressed all public exhibitions and discussions. I
      can mention but few of the names most eminent during this Anatomic Period,
      and but a short account of the life and work of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first deserving of mention was Herophilus, who was born in Chalcedon
      about the end of the fourth century before Christ, and supposed to be the
      first to undertake systematic dissection of the human body. The so-called
      Torcular Herophili, or common meeting-place of the sinuses at the occiput,
      named after him, gives evidence of his influence upon the study of
      anatomy. He wrote on all departments of medical science, concerning the
      eyes, the pulse, midwifery, etc., as well as numerous commentaries upon
      the Hippocratic writings,&mdash;describing the membranes of the brain and
      its vessels, the choroid plexus, the ventricles of the brain, the tunics
      of the eye, the intestinal canal, and certain portions of the vascular
      system. He alluded to the thoracic duct without knowing its purpose, and
      gave a more accurate description of the genitalia than any previous
      writer. Strange to say, but little is known of his later life, and of his
      death absolutely nothing.

      Erasistratus<span class="pagenum">034</span><a name="link034" id="link034"></a>
      was the son of Cleombrotus, a student of Metrodorus, and lived for some
      time at the court of Seleucus Nicator, whose son, Antiochus, he healed of
      a secret ailment, which happened to be a desperate love-affair with his
      mother-in-law, Stratonice. He wrote extensively on fevers, hygiene,
      paralyses, therapeutics, and many other subjects; regarded most diseases
      as due to overindulgence in food, which is not digested, and consequently
      putrefies. Plethora was for him the prevailing disease, against which he
      employed not only venesection, but fasting, and bandaging of the
      extremities. He was a diligent student of anatomy, and carefully described
      the brain in many of its grosser features, regarding it as the seat of the
      soul and the centre of the nerves. He also described more exactly than his
      predecessors the valves of the heart, which organ he regarded as the
      origin of veins and arteries. He discovered the lymph-vessels, and
      maintained, against Plato and others, that the epiglottis prevents the
      entrance of fluids into the lungs, but he supposed digestion to be
      produced by mechanical trituration in the stomach, and preferred
      gymnastics, exercise, diet, and baths to drugs or other therapeutic
      measures. He died about 280 B.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aretæus, who died about 170 B.C., was one of the most brilliant lights of
      antiquity previous to the Christian era, but, in spite of all this, of his
      life very little is known. He came from Cappadocia about the end of the
      reign of Nero, and lived in Alexandria. That he lived in Alexandria is
      apparent from his numerous references to its location, to the habits and
      therapeutics of the Egyptians, and to the geography of the country.
      Furthermore, references to its diseases abound in his writings, so that it
      is made to appear that he had had the best advantages there, although he
      must have traveled extensively. But a small portion of his writings
      remain, and these consist, for the most part, of compendiums of pathology
      and therapeutics. He described disease, not in anatomical order from head
      to foot, but under<span class="pagenum">035</span><a name="link035"
      id="link035"></a> the classification of acute and chronic. With the
      exception of Hippocrates, he has shown himself the most free from vague,
      arbitrary speculation, and from the dogmatism of the schools of any writer
      of antiquity. He, more than any other up to his time, endeavored to found
      pathology upon a sound anatomical basis. For every picture of disease he
      endeavored to provide a suitable anatomical accompaniment. This appears
      particularly, for instance, in his description of intestinal ulcers due to
      dysentery, or the paralyses following brain affections, or his description
      of pharyngeal diphtherias, of which he gave a good account under the name
      of Syriac or Egyptian ulcers. Pulmonary tuberculosis, tetanus, and anal
      fistula are amply mentioned in his writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      His therapeutics were simple and rational; he laid great stress upon
      dietetic treatment. His surgical writings appear to have all been lost,
      but there is every reason to think that he brought to bear upon<span
      class="pagenum">036</span><a name="link036" id="link036"></a> external
      medicine the same good sense which he applied to internal affections.

      Cornelius Celsus, the most celebrated author for a number of centuries,
      was born in Rome about the time of Christ. Brilliant as he was, he exerted
      a wide-spread influence for centuries. The exact date of his death is
      unknown. He was a contemporary of the greatest philosophers, poets, and <i>savants</i>
      of Rome during its most brilliant period. He studied rhetoric, philosophy,
      the art of war, economics, and medicine&mdash;he was, in fact, a walking
      encyclopaedia of the knowledge of his day; but it is in medicine that he
      shows to best advantage, and in his capacity as a physician he was and is
      best known. The direction in which Celsus appears to least advantage is in
      failure of power of direct observation, and in yielding unquestioning
      obedience to the views and dicta of Hippocrates, for whom he possessed the
      greatest reverence, not being able to brook any serious contradiction or
      opposition to his opinions. In this reverence for Hippocratic authority he
      was followed by many less prominent successors, the consequence being a
      failure to train men as observers, the endeavor being to make them simply
      storehouses of information derived from Hippocratic writings. As a result,
      Celsus wrote but little, or else his writings are lost. He contented
      himself mostly with a mere commentary upon the writings which he so highly
      revered. But little of his writings remain, and these pertain mostly to
      the therapeutics of curable disease, dietetic, pharmaceutical, and
      surgical. Although he exercised great authority during his period, he was
      later totally supplanted by Galen, and his views are seldom mentioned in
      the writings of those subsequent to this great physician. His death must
      have taken place during the first century after Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the students of Hippocratic dogmatism, the most earnest, skillful,
      and learned was Claudius Galen, a native of Pergamos, a place already
      celebrated for its temple dedicated<span class="pagenum">037</span><a
      name="link037" id="link037"></a> to Æsculapius, for its school of
      medicine, and for a library which had been removed to Alexandria. He was
      placed by his father under the most distinguished teachers in all of the
      sciences, and even as a young man showed extraordinary progress, and
      became early a disputant with the most erudite in grammar, history,
      mathematics, and philosophy. He has related how in two different dreams he
      was urged by Apollo to study medicine. He traveled widely for instruction,
      and remained some time in Alexandria.

      On his return to his own country he was charged by its ruler to dress the
      wounded in the great circus, which furnished him opportunity for
      displaying all his anatomical knowledge and surgical skill. Not remaining
      long at home, he went to Rome, where his renown had preceded him, and
      where, by his brilliant elocution, his accurate logic, and<span
      class="pagenum">038</span><a name="link038" id="link038"></a> his profound
      erudition, as well as his versatility and practical skill, he at once took
      the highest place. But here his rapid success, his vanity, his disdain for
      his colleagues, and his useless boasting, as well as his natural jealousy,
      gained him the enmity of nearly all his contemporaries, and his stay at
      Rome was thereby made very disagreeable. In his work on <i>Prenotions</i>
      he accuses his colleagues of base jealousy and stupid ignorance, lavishes
      upon them such epithets as "thieves" and "poisoners," and closes by saying
      that after having unmasked them he would leave them to their evil designs
      by abandoning the great city to seek a home in a smaller place, where the
      surroundings would be to him more congenial. This threat he carried out,
      but soon returned to Rome upon the invitation of the Emperors Marcus
      Aurelius and Lucius Yerus, whose confidence, as well as that of their
      successors, he enjoyed. He is supposed to have lived to the age of
      seventy-one, and to have died about 200 A.D. Galen strongly denied being
      attached to any of the sects of his day, and regarded as slaves those who
      took the title of Hippocratists, Praxagoreans, Herophilists, and so on.
      Nevertheless, his predilection in favor of the Hippocratic writings is
      well marked, for lie explains, comments upon, and expands them at length,
      refutes the objections of their adversaries, and gives them the highest
      place. He says: "No one before me has given the true method of treating
      disease; Hippocrates, I confess, lias heretofore shown the path, but as he
      was the first to enter it he was not able to go as far as he wished.... He
      has not made all the necessary distinctions, and is often obscure, as is
      usually the case with ancients when they attempt to be concise. He says
      very little of complicated diseases; in a word, he has only sketched what
      another was to complete; he has opened the path, but has left it for a
      successor to enlarge and make it plain." This implies how he regarded
      himself as the successor of Hippocrates, and how littleweight<span
      class="pagenum">039</span><a name="link039" id="link039"></a> he attached
      to the labors of others. He held that there were three sorts of principles
      in man: spirits, humors, and solids. Throughout his metaphysical
      speculations Galen reproduces and amplifies the Hippocratic dogmatism.
      Between perfect health and disease there were, he thought, eight kinds of
      temperaments or imperfect mixtures compatible with the exercise of the
      functions of life. With Plato and Aristotle, he thought the human soul to
      be composed of three faculties or parts: the vegetative, residing in the
      liver; the irascible, having its seat in the heart; and the rational,
      which resides in the brain. He divided diseases of the solids of the body
      into what he called distempers; he distinguished between the continued and
      intermittent fevers, regarding the quotidian as being caused by phlegm,
      the tertian as due to yellow bile, and the quartan as due to atrabile. In
      the doctrine of coction, crises, and critical days he agreed with
      Hippocrates; with him he also agreed in the positive statement that
      diseases are cured by their contraries. From all this it will be seen that
      Galen must be regarded as one of the earliest of Hippocratic dogmatists.
      He was a most extensive writer, and it is said that the total number of
      his works exceeded one hundred. His contributions to anatomy were not
      insignificant. For myology he did a great deal. He wrote a monograph on
      the skeleton in which he recommended that bones be seen and handled, not
      merely studied from books, and that the student should go to Alexandria,
      where teachers would place before him the real human skeleton. It has been
      inferred that there was not, in his time, in Rome a single skeleton. He
      wrote fifteen books on anatomy, of which six are lacking; also an
      extensive treatise on the lesions of the human body, distributed among
      seventeen books which have come down to us. He is supposed to have
      introduced the term "symphysis," and he described nearly every bone in the
      human body. By him the muscles were no longer considered as inert masses
      and tissue-layers<span class="pagenum">040</span><a name="link040"
      id="link040"></a> serving to cover the bones, but he classified them
      according to their distinct functions, and studied separately their form
      and uses. The location of the vessels and nerves between them was also
      noted, and it was proved that muscles were indispensable to the
      accomplishment of voluntary motions. Galen was, perhaps, the first
      vivisector of all, since he exposed muscles of living animals, and showed
      how alternate tension and relaxation of distinct groups set the bones in
      motion, after the manner of levers; he named a great number of them, but,
      curiously, took no note of others. His classification according to their
      uses is followed down to the present day&mdash;i.e., flexors, extensors,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hippocratic authors confounded the arteries with the veins. Praxagoras
      first distinguished two kinds of vessels which he supposed to contain air,
      whence the name artery. Aristotle and Erasistratus maintained this view,
      which prevailed until the time of Galen, who devoted a book to the
      refutation of it, basing his argument upon the observation that always
      when an artery is wounded blood gushes out. How near he came to being the
      discoverer of the circulation may thus be seen. A little less reverence
      for authority and a little more capacity for observation would have placed
      him in possession of the knowledge, lack of which for so many centuries
      retarded the whole profession. He thought the veins originated from the
      liver&mdash;in this respect being behind Aristotle&mdash;but considered
      the heart as the common source of the arteries and veins. Even the portal
      system of veins confused him, and he erroneously described a superior and
      inferior aorta, but atoned for this by describing the umbilical veins and
      arteries. Aristotle also had supposed all the nerves originated from the
      heart, but Galen stated that they are derived from the brain and spinal
      marrow, and pointed out two kinds of nerves: those of sensation, which he
      thought proceeded from the brain, and those of motion, which he considered<span
      class="pagenum">041</span><a name="link041" id="link041"></a> to originate
      in the spinal marrow. Thus, he described distinct nerves of sensation and
      motion, but sadly confused their anatomy. He seems also to have had some
      notion of the great sympathetic, although it was by no means accurate. He
      suggested the division of the principal nerves, in order to prove the fact
      that nervous energy is transmitted from the encephalon to other parts of
      the body. He speaks of glands, and thought they discharged their
      secretions through veins into the various cavities, but regarded them
      rather as receptacles of excrementitious matter than as agents for
      secretion of valuable fluids. He even regarded the mammæ as glandular
      bodies in this sense, although he knew, of course, the value of their
      secretion. To Galen we owe the division of the body into cranial,
      thoracic, and abdominal cavities, whose proper viscera and envelopes he
      described. He spoke of the heart as having the appearance of a muscle, but
      differing from it. He regarded it as the source of natural heat, and the
      seat of anger and of violent passions. He appreciated that inspiration is
      carried on by enlargement of the thoracic cavity. He thought that
      atmospheric air entered the cavity of the cranium through the cribriform
      plate of the ethmoid and passed out by the same route, carrying with it
      excrementitious humors from the brain, which were discharged into the
      nasal fossæ. But some portion of air thus entering remained, according to
      his views, and combined with the vital spirits in the anterior ventricles
      of the brain, from which combination originated the animal spirits and
      immediate agents of the rational soul. These acquired their last
      attenuation in the fourth ventricle, whence they would pass out drop by
      drop through a round, narrow tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this brief <i>résumé</i> of the anatomy and physiology of Galen it
      will be seen that by the end of the second century of the Christian era
      immense progress had been made since the foundation of the Alexandrian
      school, and that it was due to the impetus in the study of anatomy given
      by Herophilus<span class="pagenum">042</span><a name="link042" id="link042"></a>
      and Erasistratus, who not only made numerous dissections, but resorted to
      frequent vivisections. It is even said that Herophilus did not hesitate to
      employ his knife on live criminals who were subjected to him for
      experiment; but this has been a popular tradition about almost every
      anatomist of antiquity, and there is no evidence in confirmation of the
      unkind rumor, although that such experiments might be legally and justly
      performed has occurred to the minds of many. But zeal for dissection
      rapidly cooled off, and Galen barely mentions five or six men who devoted
      themselves to it in the space of nearly four hundred years down to his
      time. He speaks of <i>Rufus</i> of Ephesus,&mdash;who lived under Trajan
      of <i>Marinus</i>,&mdash;who wrote in the beginning of the second century
      A.D., and of <i>Quintus</i>, who instructed his own preceptor. None of
      them left a reputation, however, approaching that of Herophilus and
      Erasistratus, with whom Galen alone could compare by the number of his
      experiments and his discoveries. Galen strove as hard as one of his
      position might, by example and precept, to awaken in his contemporaries a
      desire for anatomical knowledge, but could not overcome their
      indifference. After him the practice of dissection appears to have been
      lost, either from the redoubled prejudices of the superstitious, who
      opposed it, or as the result of the apathetic ignorance or the ignorant
      apathy of the physicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been shown that, during the Hippocratic era and subsequently, the
      physicians even of primitive times followed more or less by instinct the
      empirical method. Acron of Agrigentum was a contemporary of Pythagoras,
      and affirmed that experience is the only true foundation of the healing
      art. Hippocrates, however, showed himself more anxious to report
      faithfully clinical facts than to dispute theoretical views.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprising progress in anatomy and physiology made during the first
      portion of the Anatomic Period and during<span class="pagenum">043</span><a
      name="link043" id="link043"></a> the better days of the Alexandrian
      institute did not keep men from confounding several different points in
      the Hippocratic doctrine, by which confidence in the same was naturally
      shaken. Thus many new speculations were hazarded which nullified each
      other. In the midst of this confusion practitioners continued to seek in
      experience a refuge from the incessant variations of dogmatism and the
      sterile incertitude of the skeptics. Thus, empiricism as a school of
      practice became placed upon a firmer and firmer foundation, and the
      empirics of that day seem to have laid the true basis of our art. Their
      doctrine took at first a rapid growth, and Galen spoke of it with great
      regard. The circumstances under which it was proclaimed were most
      favorable for its propagation. Theories had fallen into confusion;
      practice, methods, and opinions were questionable. Everything was
      conjecture, and that which rested on the evidence of facts was by the
      empirics received with enthusiasm. Although founded on pure observation,
      it did not put an end to differences of opinion, and in the eyes of the
      ancients it lacked in solidity, because it did not attach itself to any
      philosophic theory then known. This doctrine was then best able to
      captivate physicians on account of its simplicity, contrasted with the
      general inability to satisfy speculative minds; but for this very reason
      it subsequently fell into disgrace, and the term "empiricism" became
      synonymous with ignorance. For centuries condemned and despised, it was
      revived from its long humiliation under the name of the Experimental
      Method, and achieved, after the labors of Bacon, Locke, and Condillac,
      almost universal dominion in the sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine had been proclaimed for about a century during the period of
      which we now speak, but later led men into a fondness for secondary
      generalities or for the elevation and magnifying of trifles, which
      confused their minds and terminated its usefulness to science. Meanwhile,
      a man of great intelligence, renowned as an elocutionist, well<span
      class="pagenum">044</span><a name="link044" id="link044"></a> versed in
      the doctrine of philosophers and grammarians&mdash;namely, <i>Asclepiades</i>,
      of Bythinia&mdash;came to Rome with the intention of teaching rhetoric. By
      his talent and personal address he soon became one of the most illustrious
      persons in the Roman Republic; so early as 150 B.C. he enjoyed a high
      reputation as a rhetorician, and was one of the intimate friends of
      Cicero; nevertheless, he abandoned letters, undertook the practice of
      medicine, and sought moreover to create a new system, being unwilling to
      follow in the track of his predecessors. Imbued with the philosophy of
      Epicurus, who was then in high repute, he deduced from it a theory which
      was in harmony with the philosophy of the day. He thought that the
      elements of the body existed from eternity; that they were indivisible,
      impalpable, and perceptible to the reason only. These elements he named <i>atoms</i>,
      which were supposed to be animated by perpetual motion, and from which, by
      their frequent encounters and fortuitous contention, all sensible
      phenomena were supposed to result. He explained the properties of the body
      by saying that compounds were aggregates of atoms, differing very much
      from atoms themselves. Solid silver, he said, is white, but, reduced to
      powder, appears black; the horn of the goat, on the contrary, is black,
      but if it be razed its particles are white. This, it will be seen, was the
      parent of our present atomic theory. He ridiculed the theories of
      Hippocrates concerning coction, crises, etc., and sarcastically called the
      Hippocratic treatise on therapeutics "a meditation on death."
    </p>
    <p>
      Asclepiades based his own therapeutics on endeavors so to enlarge the
      pores of the human body that disease could find egress, or so to constrict
      them that it could not enter; consequently he rejected all violent
      remedies, such as vomits, purges, etc., and his favorite remedies were
      hygienic,&mdash;for the most part bodily exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A celebrated disciple of Asclepiades was <i>Themison</i>, of Laodicea
      (b.c. 50), who was led by the teachings of his master to<span
      class="pagenum">045</span><a name="link045" id="link045"></a> lay the
      foundation of the so-called <i>Methodism</i> as opposed to <i>Dogmatism</i>
      in the school of Cos. By him and his followers a very arbitrary
      arrangement of diseases was made, according to what they considered the
      constrictive, or contractive; the fluxionary,&mdash;congested or relaxed;
      and the mixed forms. From this division of diseases it appears that,
      according to the methodists, there were only two kinds of therapeutic
      indications to follow,&mdash;namely, to relax where there was
      constriction, to constrict where there was relaxation. They, however,
      admitted a third creditable result, which they called prophylactic; but
      the pure methodists, such as Ccelius Aurelianus, admitted neither specific
      disease nor specific remedies, and erased from their materia medica
      purgatives, diuretics, emmenagogues, nauseants, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the methodist doctrine, the study of medicine was so abridged
      that one of its prominent exponents said that he felt able to teach the
      whole of medical science in six months. It made rapid progress, and
      consequently was most attractive to the numerous young neophytes who were
      anxious to finish their apprenticeship and hasten into practice. It is not
      one of the smallest of the services which Galen rendered to his time and
      to posterity that he demolished the sophistry of the methodists,
      demonstrated the insufficiency of their practice, and brought to bear upon
      them the wittiest satire, calling them the asses of Thessaly, alluding
      thereby to their lack of literature and medical instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summing up, then, the basis for the various systems of medicine during
      this period of antiquity, it is seen that the most ancient doctrine of all&mdash;<i>Dogmatism</i>&mdash;directs
      our attention especially to the animal economy in health and disease; that
      it took account of the union of vital forces, of sympathies in the
      organism, and of nature's efforts to repel both internal and external
      deleterious influences, which<span class="pagenum">046</span><a
      name="link046" id="link046"></a> providential tendency manifests itself
      especially in certain acute diseases. This was the strong side of
      dogmatism. Its weak side consisted in this: that it was held that the
      causes of diseases inhere in the access of certain qualities and humors
      along with organic forces,&mdash;such as dryness or moisture in
      combination with bile or atrabile,&mdash;and the treatment was directed
      against these supposed causes. It was on account of this weakness that the
      enemies of dogmatism attacked it. The empirics opposed the idea that
      inaccessible and occult causes of disease could become the basis for
      rational treatment. They affirmed that there was no consistent relation of
      antagonism or similitude between the disease and the remedies which cured
      it.
    </p>

      The <i>Methodists</i> somewhat improved on the doctrine of empiricism, but
      ran wild in its improvement and erected over their fundamental theory such
      a superstructure of secondary and tertiary generalities as to cause the
      fundamental part to be entirely obscured from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were not lacking, in those days of old, certain educated physicians
      who more or less vaguely comprehended that the entire truth of medicine
      did not inhere in any one of these systems, but that there was good and
      evil in each. These men, not being able to establish general rules, tried
      to decide practical questions according to their fancy or their reason.
      They assumed the name of <i>Eclectics</i> or <i>Episynthetics</i>, meaning
      thereby that they adopted no exclusive system, but selected from each that
      which seemed to them best. They did not constitute a sect, because they
      had no precise dogmas nor theories, but they should not be confounded with
      the Pyrrhonians, who held to doubt as a fundament doctrine, the true
      eclectic doubting only that which he could not understand. True
      eclecticism in medicine, however, is rather the absence of fixed
      principles, or, as Renouard says, it is "individualism erected into a
      dogma, which escapes refutation because it is deficient<span
      class="pagenum">047</span><a name="link047" id="link047"></a> in
      principle." Many became eclectics to avoid discussing principles, and made
      of it a shelter. In one sense, then, an eclectic is one destitute of
      profound convictions, who sides with no particular party, is committed to
      no person or doctrine, and who is often so indifferent that he cannot
      judge with impartiality; consequently, to be truly eclectic is different
      from being an adherent of a school of eclecticism.

      During the historic period just reviewed, anatomy and physiology made most
      progress, next internal and external nosography, and next to these medical
      and surgical therapeutics, and although Coelius Aurelianus and Aretæus
      have left to us by far the best books issued up to their times,
      nevertheless not one of the writers of this period has achieved the
      distinction in which Hippocrates is held, since he, perhaps more than any
      other, combined intelligence, sincerity, disinterestedness, love of his
      art, and humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the classification of Renouard, already alluded to, the so-called <i>Age
      of Transition</i> includes centuries commencing with the death of Galen,
      about A.D. 201, and ending with the revival of letters in Europe, about
      the year 1400. The first period of this transition age is the so-called
      Greek Period, which ends with the burning of the Alexandrian library, A.D.
      640.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time when this historic period commenced all the known world was
      under the dominance of a single man. The power of Septimus Severus had
      more extent than that of Alexander the Great, and bid fair to be of a much
      longer existence. The Roman dominion, cemented by seven hundred years of
      bold and persevering government, seemed almost immovable. While the
      savages upon its frontiers occasionally troubled its peace, none were
      strong enough to penetrate its centres or place it in real peril. The
      great civil wars had ceased, or changed their object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the<span class="pagenum">048</span><a name="link048" id="link048"></a>
      people and the senate, those two eternal competitors, had gotten over the
      struggle for supreme power; monarchial government was accepted as a matter
      of fact, and the citizens contended only for choice of a master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar changes had taken place in the domain of the mind; philosophical
      discussions, which were so essentially a part of the schools of the
      ancient Greeks, had nearly lost their interest and were being
      discontinued. Such disputes as took place related less to principle than
      to interpretation of the language of the teacher. In morals, Plato,
      Epicurus, and Zeno were followed until the principles of Christianity
      gradually supplanted their teaching; in physics and metaphysics the
      authority of Aristotle, and in medicine that of Galen, were simply
      undisputed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditions being such as these, there was naturally but one sect in
      medicine, and one method of study and practice. Medical science
      retrograded rather than progressed, sad to say, and was undisturbed by any
      remarkable revolution. The scepter of medicine passed from the hands of
      one nation to those of another, and the language of Hippocrates and Galen
      was later replaced, as will duly be seen, by that of Avicenna and
      Albucassis. But this Greek Period, which is one of transition, offers
      little for our consideration more than the lives and writings of four of
      its most eminent physicians, who by their study in the school of
      Alexandria, and by their writings and teachings, left reputations which
      were sustained until the invasion of the Arabs. Of these it may be said
      that, while they did little or nothing original, and simply commented upon
      the writings of Hippocrates and Galen, they kept burning the torch of
      medical learning which else had been almost extinguished by their indolent
      contemporaries. Of these various commentators&mdash;for they were little
      more than that&mdash;the first of any importance after Galen was <i>Oribasius</i>,
      who was horn in Pergamos (328-403); he early attached himself to the
      fortunes of Julian the Apostate, and followed him into Gaul when he was<span
      class="pagenum">049</span><a name="link049" id="link049"></a> made its
      governor. Julian appreciated the good qualities of Oribasius, made him an
      intimate friend, and after he himself became emperor appointed his friend
      as quæstor at Constantinople. After the emperor's untimely death,
      Oribasius remained faithful to his memory, but his jealous colleagues so
      falsely and so successfully misrepresented his fidelity that he was
      disgraced, spoiled of his office and property, and banished among a
      barbarous people. In this new field, however, he displayed such courage,
      effected such extraordinary cures, discoursed so eloquently, and so
      attached to himself the savage men around him, that he was by them
      regarded as a god. The fame of this homage in time reached the ears of the
      Emperors Valens and Valentinianus, who recalled him, reimbursed him for
      his losses, and permitted him to enjoy his high reputation and fortune to
      the end of his days. He was held to be the wisest man of his time, most
      skillful in medicine, and the most charming in conversation. He dedicated
      a collection of seventy books to Julian, his first patron, and edited, at
      a later period, an abridgment of this work for the benefit of his son. His
      principal merit consisted in reproducing the ideas of others with such
      clearness, order, and precision that the summaries that he gives of them
      are often preferable to the originals. What he has said of pregnant women,
      nursing, and the earliest education of the child has been copied literally
      by writers for twelve centuries since his time. It must be said of him,
      however, that his prepossession in favor of Galen was so great that he
      adopted servilely his ideas and even his words to such an extent that he
      has been surnamed "the ape of Galen."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ætius</i> was born in Mesopotamia in the year 502 and died in 575. He
      studied at Alexandria, and afterward went to Constantinople, where he
      became a chamberlain at court. Ætius was the first medical man of any note
      who professed Christianity, as is shown by such passages as this one: he
      said that<span class="pagenum">050</span><a name="link050" id="link050"></a>
      in the composition of certain medicaments the following words should be
      repeated in a low voice: "May the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
      the God of Jacob deign to bestow upon this medicament such and such
      virtues." In another place he recommends that to extract a bone from the
      throat the following words be pronounced: "Bone&mdash;as Christ caused
      Lazarus to come forth from the sepulchre, as Jonah came out of the whale's
      belly&mdash;come out of the throat or go down." But he exhibits the same
      credulity in not doubting the miraculous virtues attributed by the quacks
      of his day to most remedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Oribasius, he collected everything that he found remarkable in the
      writings of his predecessors, and has preserved certain fragments of
      antiquity which would otherwise have been lost. His work formed a complete
      manual of medicine and surgery, except that it lacked anatomical
      descriptions and references to dislocations and fractures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Alexander</i> of Tralles (525-605), a city of Lydia, where Greek was
      spoken, was a son of the physician Stephen, and the most celebrated of
      five sons, who were all distinguished for their learning. He traveled
      extensively, and fixed his residence in Rome, where he became celebrated.
      He lived to an advanced age, and, being no longer able to practice,
      composed a treatise of twelve books, exclusively devoted to affections
      that did not require the aid of surgery. He professed the greatest
      veneration for Galen, but did not blindly adopt his opinions. He described
      the first reported case of excessive hunger and pain due to intestinal
      worms; he advised venesection in the foot rather than in the arm; but with
      all his sound judgment and mental enlightenment he had faith in amulets
      and talismans, and widely recommended them. It may be said for him, such
      was the universal prejudice of his age, the whole world being plunged in
      superstition, that it was necessary for every one to pay some tribute to
      the prevailing belief; and we may add that it is necessary to make this
      excuse for some who practice much<span class="pagenum">051</span><a
      name="link051" id="link051"></a> nearer to ourselves than did those
      ancient physicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Paul, or Paulus</i>, surnamed <i>Ægineta</i> (because he was born in
      the Island of Ægina), was among the last of the Greek physicians who have
      special interest for us. It is supposed that he died about A.D. 690. He
      traveled extensively, and his skill in surgery and obstetrics rendered him
      celebrated even among the Arabs, whose midwives sent for him in
      consultation from great distances. He composed a compendium of medicine,
      divided into seven books, and not only did not hesitate to borrow from his
      predecessors, but quoted from them most extensively; a number of his
      chapters were taken almost <i>verbatim</i> from Oribasius; however, he
      made no secret of it, but rather boasted that he had judiciously sought to
      appropriate the best of the writings of those he most revered. He showed
      originality, however, in the treatment of hydrocephalus, in advising
      paracentesis of the thorax and abdomen, in the extraction of calculi from
      the bladder, in the treatment of aneurism, the excision of hypertrophied
      mammæ in men, etc. He was the first to describe varicose aneurism, and the
      first to perform the operation of bronchotomy after the method borrowed
      from <i>Antyllus</i>, of which he has transmitted a very detailed account.
      Of this Antyllus, by the way, it may be added, <i>en passant</i>, that he
      was one of the most distinguished and original surgeons of antiquity. He
      flourished during the third century after Christ; was the first to
      describe the extraction of small cataracts; and is, perhaps, best known to
      the surgical world to-day by his exceedingly bold plan of opening
      aneurisms, so successfully imitated a generation or so ago by James Syme.

    <p>
      It has already been seen that before and during the early centuries of the
      Christian era the secrets and learning of the physicians tended to pass
      gradually into the hands of the priests. It was so in the temples of
      ancient Greece, it was so in Alexandria, it became so in Rome, it has been
      so even<span class="pagenum">052</span><a name="link052" id="link052"></a>
      in modern times, although only for brief periods of time. This has come
      about in some measure from the cupidity of the clerical orders, partly
      because it required a certain amount of intelligence and knowledge to
      become a priest, and partly because, owing to ignorance, credulity, and
      superstition, diseases have at all times been regarded by the ignorant as
      evidence of divine wrath and chastisement, or of diabolical or occult
      influences, rather than the effect of natural causes. Hence men have
      turned ever toward prayers, exorcism, and expiation, especially when
      exhorted thereto by the priests. This has been the sacerdotal aspect of
      the practice of medicine in all times, and when the priests have usurped
      therapeutic functions they have done harm rather than good. So long as
      theology and science work hand in hand, each redounds to the credit of the
      other, but always in the history of man when theology has appropriated
      that which did not belong to it it has brought ridicule upon itself and
      has delayed the progress of knowledge. There have been frequent rebellions
      against religious authority in ancient as in modern times. For instance,
      at the commencement of the fifth century before Christ the Pythagoreans
      were dispersed, and the doctrines of Cos and Cnidus&mdash;i.e. the
      Hippocratic teachings&mdash;were promulgated; and again, in the course of
      events, when the descendants of Æsculapius became servile attendants at
      the temple and adjuncts to the priesthood or a part of it. At first, in
      Alexandria, the physicians were supreme; their disciples, however, had the
      same blind reverence for authority that too many workers in the field of
      theology have evinced, and men once more practiced medicine on the
      traditions of the past, and in so doing allied themselves more and more to
      the temples in Rome. At first, the oldest and best instructed of the
      relatives treated the diseases of his family as he understood them; simply
      shared this duty with its other members. Cato, the censor, was much
      engrossed with this domestic medicine;<span class="pagenum">053</span><a
      name="link053" id="link053"></a> he wrote a book in which he recommended
      cabbage as a sovereign remedy in many diseases. He venerated the number 3,
      as did the Pythagoreans; did not disdain to transmit to posterity certain
      medical words which it was believed should be repeated to assist in the
      reduction of dislocations and fractures. This old censor seemed to have a
      profound hatred for medical men, and most absurd ideas of their works and
      claims, although doubtless many Greek physicians who came to Rome merited
      the invectives which he launched against them. Then came Asclepiades, of
      Bythinia, as already mentioned, whose talents were far superior to those
      of his Roman contemporaries, and who did not need to call to his aid
      charlatanism and deceit. This medical hero unfortunately had many
      worthless and dishonest imitators, who appealed to superstition and
      ignorance in every dishonest way, and who desired to be judged by the
      luxury and elegance they displayed. Hence for a long time in Rome medicine
      was practiced without license. The Emperor Anthony the Pious was the first
      to occupy himself with regulating the practice of medicine. He granted
      certain immunities, but did ask for proof of qualifications. A certain
      physician to Nero, Adromachus, was honored by the emperor with the title
      of Archiater.&mdash; i.e., royal healer.&mdash;but Galen, who was
      physician to Marcus Aurelius, never bore it. From the time of Constantine
      the Great, however, the title is frequently met with in the edicts of the
      emperors. In fact, there were two sorts of these.&mdash;one named the
      Palatine, who belonged to the household of the reigning monarch and who
      held high rank among the nobility; and the other called the Popular
      Archiaters, who were public-health officers. No one could practice
      medicine in the jurisdiction of one of these without examination and
      authorization. Those who transgressed this regulation were punished with a
      fine of two thousand drachmas. The Popular Archiaters were pensioned by
      the city, enjoyed certain privileges, and had to<span class="pagenum">054</span><a
      name="link054" id="link054"></a> attend the poor gratuitously.
      Practitioners who were not members of the College of Archiaters had no
      pay, no rights, nor emoluments. The Popular Archiaters were elected by the
      citizens from many candidates who had proved their capacity before the
      college of this medical organization. The evils of medical anarchy were
      thus remedied; this happy condition existed until the empire was broken up
      by barbarism.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is during this period&mdash;about 400 A.D.&mdash;that we first find a
      class of citizens to whom was delegated the duty of preparing drugs
      ordered by physicians. Their duties were in some respects similar to those
      of our apothecaries, although in attainment and in social position they
      were far below the physicians. They were termed <i>pharmacopolists</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth while to stop a moment to inquire what were the medical
      charitable institutions of antiquity. Even in the days of ancient Athens
      there was a certain gymnasium, called the Cynosarga, in which abandoned
      and illegitimate children were brought up at public expense until such
      time as they were able to serve their country. A little later several
      private institutions of this kind were established. Rome in her earlier
      day never had such institutions. To be sure, she distributed provisions,
      or else remitted taxes, to parents who were unable to support their
      children, or even permitted them to destroy their newborn children when
      unable to maintain them; but there were no bonds of sympathy which induced
      the patricians to succor the plebeians in time of disease and distress;
      slaves were cared for as were cattle. It is one of the debts we owe
      Christianity that, under its influence, the first almshouses and retreats
      were established in Rome. It has been said that the Emperor Marcus
      Aurelius first instituted anything like a dispensary service in the Sacred
      City. We are told, also, of an illustrious woman, St. Pauline, living in
      the midst of the greatest wealth and pomp,<span class="pagenum">055</span><a
      name="link055" id="link055"></a> who retired from society and devoted her
      life to charity and self-denial. She went to Jerusalem, united with other
      Christian women of the same mission, and formed, under the direction of
      St. Jerome, a sisterhood whose members divided their time between reading
      sacred books and doing good works. They offered an asylum for the faithful
      and a hospice for the benefit of the indigent sick, and even established a
      home for convalescents outside the city-walls. After the model thus set,
      heathen emperors, Christian kings, and Moslem caliphs showed their zeal in
      this good direction by the erection of sumptuous edifices and other rich
      endowments for the relief of suffering human beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reviewing now the Greek period, let it be remembered that in the time of
      Galen animals were dissected, and that he made anatomical demonstrations
      on monkeys; that sometimes the corpses of the enemy were rudely dissected
      upon the field of battle, but that finally the practice of dissection fell
      into disuse, and human anatomy was studied only from books, the early
      Christians having evinced even more horror of the dead body for the
      purposes of anatomical study than did their pagan predecessors, while the
      Fathers of primitive times launched their anathemas against the dissection
      of human remains. Here, again, as usual, the interference of the church
      worked only general harm. This abandonment of anatomy contributed
      doubtless to the decadence of medicine; by the rapid extension of
      Christianity the pagan schools were disorganized and broken up, the
      profane sciences (such as medicine) were discarded, and the teachers still
      remaining in the old schools were ruined. Passion for religious
      controversy was engendered and took the place of study or original
      research, even to such an extent as to hasten the fall of the Empire of
      the East. In addition to these factors, reverence for authority of the
      past&mdash;that terribly oppressive weight which has kept down so much
      which would otherwise<span class="pagenum">056</span><a name="link056"
      id="link056"></a> have risen early, and which has been the greatest enemy
      of human learning&mdash;permitted the explanation of natural phenomena to
      be sought only in the writings of revered ancients, and not in living
      beings. No one dared to advocate changes in regard to received doctrines,
      and there could be no such thing as progress. Only two men in the lapse of
      four centuries showed any originality; these were Alexander of Tralles and
      Paul of Ægina, whose lives have already been briefly rehearsed. It is with
      some relief, however, that we can think that this period, so unfruitful in
      scientific progress, was not so in social amelioration. By the
      organization of the institutions above alluded to charlatanism was
      checked, by the requirement of capability and good character society was
      benefited, and the charitable institutes of this epoch perhaps gave the
      world its best models in teaching and an insight into the most valuable
      means of medical instruction. Of the old Greek Period, then, we may say
      that it accrues rather to the benefit of humanity than to that of science.

      which began with the second destruction of the Alexandrian Library&mdash;640
      A.D.&mdash;ends with the fourteenth century. At the commencement of this
      period the Roman Empire of the West scarcely existed: the magnificent
      territory which composed it had been overrun and subdued by barbarous
      tribes from the forests of the North, while from its ruins had risen
      several independent kingdoms,&mdash;that of the Franks in Gallia, of the
      Visigoths in Spain, and of the Lombards in Italy. The last of the Western
      emperors of note was Justinian, whose army and generals&mdash;especially
      the genius and heroic devotion of Belisarius&mdash;threw some glory upon
      Italy, Sicily, Africa, and Spain. Meantime the Empire of the East,
      surrounded by enemies, and harassed from all directions, still sustained
      itself with vigor. The Turks had begun to show themselves on the banks of
      the Danube; those eternal enemies of Rome&mdash;the Persians&mdash;made
      incessant war; and a new and terrible enemy had sprung up in the deserts
      of Arabia. Then came one who was at the same time legislator, prophet, and
      conqueror, and united under one faith and one leader tribes hitherto
      divided and warring against each other. Thus arose a powerful and
      enthusiastic nation, animated by thirst for conquest and ardor for
      proselytism. In less than a century after the first preaching of Mahomet,
      all of Arabia, India, Syria, and Egypt were in the hands of his followers.
      In the year 640 Amrou effected the conquest of Egypt, seized Alexandria,
      and the great library of five hundred thousand volumes was, by order of
      Omar (successor to<span class="pagenum">058</span><a name="link058"
      id="link058"></a> Mahomet), delivered over to the flames; and the
      historian Abulpharagius declares that these books served for six months to
      heat the public baths, four thousand in number. Such were the first fruits
      of the establishment of Islam. * Happily, zeal of proselytism somewhat
      abated among the Mussulman princes, and religious fervor gave place to
      policy; so that the later Arabian caliphs showed themselves, in general,
      the protectors of the arts and sciences. Some, indeed, endeavored to
      collect the <i>débris</i> of the scattered treasures that had been so
      fortunate as to escape the ignorant fanaticism of their predecessors; and
      others, more tolerant even than the Christian princes of the time,
      received without distinction all men of merit who took refuge in their
      State, gave them employment, and recompensed them for their services. On
      this account philosophers and persecuted "heretics" sought an asylum among
      infidels, and found there the protection which Christianity did not
      afford,&mdash;in return for which they gave their protectors the benefits
      of Greek civilization.

      general enlightenment was Haroun-al-Raschid, the Charlemagne of the East,
      contemporary and emulator of the glory of the emperor of the Franks, the
      hero of a hundred Arabic poems, whose dominion extended from the borders
      of the Indus to the heart of the Spanish peninsula. He embellished Bagdad,
      his capital, with schools and hospitals. His son Almamon founded the
      Academy of Bagdad, which became the most celebrated of the age; likewise
      spared no pains to draw to his court the most illustrious men of all
      countries. He enjoined each of his ambassadors to purchase all the
      writings of the philosophers and physicians that could be found, and these
      he required to be translated into Arabic; his interpreter, Honain, a
      Christian, was employed at translating for forty-five<span class="pagenum">059</span><a
      name="link059" id="link059"></a> years, and received, for each book
      rendered into Arabic, literally its weight in gold.

      The eclat which the Moorish caliphs shed upon Spain from the tenth to the
      thirteenth century is well known. The cities of Cordova, Toledo, Seville,
      and Murcia possessed public libraries and academies, and students from all
      parts of Europe flocked to them to be instructed in arts and sciences; the
      library of Cordova alone embraced more than two hundred and twenty-four
      thousand volumes. Thus it will be seen that the dominion of mental and
      temporal affairs passed from the Greeks and Romans to the Saracens.

      Arabian medicine constitutes one of the most interesting chapters in the
      history of our art. An offspring from Greek schools, it was for nearly one
      hundred years the fostermother of that art, and, although it gave rise to
      no great discovery nor wonderful step in advance during all this period,
      it nevertheless kept alive all the learning of the past, and clarified
      rather than made it turbid. In the sixth century the Nestorians (followers
      of Bishop Nestor), having been driven out of Syria, settled in Persia,
      Mesopotamia, and Arabia, and there founded schools and other institutions
      such as they had had at home,&mdash;schools in which, beside the ordinary
      philosophic studies, medicine received a share of attention. Thus it came
      about that by the seventh century Arabian physicians were everywhere known
      and in high repute. Naturally the basis for their studies embodied the
      writings of Hippocrates, Galen, Oribasius, and Paul of Ægina; and the
      first Arabian works consisted solely of translations from the Greek, first
      out of their Syriac rendering, and later from the originals. Indeed, so
      much eminence was finally achieved by Arabian physicians that more than
      four hundred are known by name as authors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first author deserving of mention was <i>Bachtischua</i>, of Nestorian
      stock, celebrated in Jondisapur, director of the medical school, and later
      physician to Caliph El-Mansur, in Bagdad.<span class="pagenum">060</span><a
      name="link060" id="link060"></a> Of his descendants several became well
      known in the same field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alkindus&mdash;this being the Latin arrangement of his Arabic name&mdash;came
      from a Persian family, who lived first in Basara and later at the court of
      the caliphs El-Monon and El-Motasin, in Bagdad. He enjoyed a very high
      reputation as physician, philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, and
      died A.D. 873. Mesue, the first of his name, sometimes known as Janus
      Damascenus, was director of the hospital in Bagdad and physician to
      Haroun-al-Raschid. He was born in 777, wrote extensively (since at least
      forty of his works have been catalogued), and died in 857 in Samarra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serapion the elder, also sometimes known as Janus Damascenus, and whose
      Arabic name was Serafiun, was born in Damascus&mdash;the exact data is not
      known&mdash;and died some time prior to A.D. 930. He was author of two
      volumes of aphorisms concerning the practice of medicine, which had at his
      time the greatest repute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most celebrated of the early Arabian physicians was Rhazes, born in
      the Persian province of Khorassan A.D. 850. According to the historians of
      his nation he was a universal genius, equally famous in music, astronomy,
      mathematics, chemistry, and medicine; he was surnamed "The Experienced."
      At the age of fifty he was one of the most distinguished professors in the
      Academy of Bagdad, where students came from great distances to listen to
      him. Chosen from among a hundred colleagues to direct the grand hospital
      of that city, he displayed indefatigable zeal and most scholarly learning,
      even to his old age and in spite of loss of sight, which overtook him at
      the age of eighty, when his reputation was at its height. Two years after
      this misfortune&mdash;i.e., in 932&mdash;he died. His generosity, which
      was proverbial, and his compassion for the poor left him penniless at the
      time of his death. Some two hundred and thirty-seven monographs of his
      have been<span class="pagenum">061</span><a name="link061" id="link061"></a>
      catalogued, though the greater number of his works are practically lost.
      Two treatises on medicine remain which afford excellent counsel in many
      respects; among other matters he advises:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Study carefully the antecedents of the man to whose care you propose to
      confide all you have most dear in this world,&mdash;that is, your life and
      the lives of your wife and children. If the man is dissipated, is given to
      frivolous pleasures, cultivates with too much zeal the arts foreign to his
      profession, still more if he be addicted to wine and debauchery, refrain
      from committing into such hands lives so precious."
    </p>
    <p>
      His greatest publication was <i>Continens</i>&mdash;extracts compiled from
      all authors for his own use&mdash;divided into thirty-seven books,
      constituting an abridgment of the science of medicine and surgery up to
      his time; and, notwithstanding its imperfect state, this work was held in
      greatest reverence, and was a common source of knowledge among Orientals
      long after his day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haly-Abbas, a Persian by birth, flourished fifty years after Rhazes, and
      died A.D. 994. His <i>Almalelci</i>, in twenty volumes, constituted a
      quite complete system of theory and practice of medicine, which, however,
      was in large measure taken from Rhazes's <i>Continens</i>. It is generally
      regarded as the best work of any of the physicians of the Arabic Period;
      it is divided into three parts&mdash;a book on Health, a book on Death,
      and a book of Signs&mdash;and it is interesting to know that the portion
      devoted to midwifery and obstetrics was in the hands not only of the
      profession, but also of the midwives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avicenna&mdash;Latinized form of his Arabic name, Ebn Sina&mdash;was born
      in Bokhara in 980. From his earliest youth he manifested a remarkable
      disposition for scientific study, and it is claimed that he mastered the
      entire Koran at the age of ten years; also that he devoted his entire days
      and the greater part of his nights to research, mastering philosophy,<span
      class="pagenum">062</span><a name="link062" id="link062"></a> mathematics,
      astronomy, and, later, medicine, which he studied at the university at
      Bagdad, in which city his talents were chiefly exhibited. He was received
      at court, loaded with favors, and elevated to the dignity of Vizier, but
      suddenly fell into disgrace, was deprived of property, imprisoned, and
      even threatened with execution. After two years, however, he was restored
      to liberty, and once more possessed the consideration of the public and
      the court, becoming the recipient of new honors. Meantime he had given
      himself up to intemperance, by which his previously robust constitution
      was undermined, and this, with excessive labor, brought about his demise
      at the too early age of fifty-six, in the year 1037. He was author of
      several books, the chief being the <i>Canon Medicinae</i>, which remained
      a classic for six centuries, constituting the medical code of Asia and
      Saracenic Europe; no author since Galen had enjoyed so wide and extensive
      authority in the medical world; and in the various medical schools
      professors, for the most part, confined themselves to reading the <i>Canon</i>
      from their desks, explaining and commenting upon its text. The work was
      divided into five volumes, of which the first two comprised the principles
      of physiology, pathology, hygiene, and therapeutics, arranged to conform
      to the teachings of Aristotle and Galen; the third and fourth dealt with
      treatment; and the fifth wras devoted to the preparation and composition
      of remedies. Avicenna appears to have surpassed in subtlety both Aristotle
      and Galen; he was fond of metaphysical speculation, and his works were too
      much filled out with subtleties of language rather than with true science.
      Authors of this period were fond of torturing in every way possible the
      writings which they undertook to edit or quote from, and, instead of
      devoting themselves to original research, wasted time in seeking for vague
      and hidden meanings. That man was most esteemed as learned who could see
      the greatest subtlety in some passage from one of<span class="pagenum">063</span><a
      name="link063" id="link063"></a> the ancient writers; consequently, that
      which was obscure or unintelligible was deemed the most sublime and
      philosophic. A very brief study of the <i>Canon</i>, for instance, will
      show this, while in graphic pictures of disease the work by no means
      approaches those of Aretæus or Alexander of Tralles, for Avicenna too
      often contented himself with mentioning merely a list of symptoms without
      indicating in any way their progression, characters, or duration.
      Undoubtedly just was the criticism of an Arabian poet: "His philosophy had
      no sound foundation, and his medical knowledge availed him naught for the
      possession of personal health and long life."

      Albucassis was born in Zahra, near Cordova, about the beginning of the
      eleventh century, and is supposed to have died A.D. 1122, at the advanced
      age of one hundred and one. He was author of an abridgment, or
      compilation, devoted to the practice of medicine, the only novelty of
      which is a small portion devoted to surgery, in which are described
      certain instruments. He says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have detailed briefly the methods of operations; I have described all
      necessary instruments, and I present their forms by means of drawings; in
      a word, I have omitted nothing of what can shed light to the
      profession.... But one of the principal reasons why it is so rare to meet
      a successful surgeon is that the apprenticeship of this branch is very
      long, and he who devotes himself to it must be versed in the science of
      anatomy, of which Galen has transmitted us the knowledge.... In fine, no
      one should permit himself to attempt this difficult art without having a
      perfept knowledge of anatomy and the action of remedies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word is said about dissections, however, from which we conclude that
      they were not tolerated in his time. He resorted enthusiastically to the
      cautery, and recommended it in spontaneous luxations and the commencement
      of curvature of the spine. He refers particularly to instrumental<span
      class="pagenum">064</span><a name="link064" id="link064"></a> delivery and
      the extraction of the after-birth, and, when speaking of fractures and
      dislocations, he remarks: "This part of surgery has been abandoned to men
      of vulgar and uncultivated minds, for which reason it has fallen into
      undeserved contempt."

      Avenzoar, born in 1113, of a Spanish family which had many illustrious
      scions, was instructed in medicine by his father, and ultimately achieved
      great celebrity throughout Spain and Africa; for a time he lived at the
      court of the Prince of Seville, loaded with honors and presents, and
      finally was made Vizier. Among other works he wrote a treatise on renal
      diseases, in which he outlined the treatment of calculus and described an
      operation therefor. He died in 1161.

    <p>
      Averroës (as he is generally known, though his Arabic name was Aben
      Roschd) was born A.D. 1166, in Cordova, where<span class="pagenum">065</span><a
      name="link065" id="link065"></a> his father held official position. After
      being grounded in philosophy, mathematics, and other sciences he became a
      pupil in medicine under Avenzoar. The greater part of his life wras passed
      in Seville, where he was greatly esteemed and finally knighted. In 1195 he
      was called to the court of the King of Spain and Morocco, in Cordova,
      where he received the highest honors, only, however, through some
      misunderstanding, to be disgraced; but he soon afterward recovered his
      former position and dignities. He wrote extensively not only on medicine,
      but on philosophy, his writings taking throughout a more or less dialectic
      character. He died in 1198, and from him descended a number of physicians
      who achieved more or less reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Maimonides</i> was born in Cordova, A.D. 1135. He early devoted himself
      to the Talmud, and in his extended travels visited Jerusalem; he even
      founded a school of philosophy in the East, which, however, had only a
      brief existence. He died in 1204. He ranked higher in philosophy than in
      medical art, and seems to have been imbued with the methods of his
      teacher, Averroës, and is generally regarded as a theorist rather than as
      a practical physician, although he wrote more or less on medical topics,
      and is particularly remembered for an essay upon poisons. He was about the
      last of the Arabians who deserves special mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the period which was nearing its close at the time of the death of
      Maimonides, the Arabs embraced with much ardor the study of medicine, and
      translated into their language nearly all the treasures that had been
      amassed by the Greeks; indeed, the preservation of many of the great
      writings which would otherwise have been lost is due solely to this fact.
      Strange to say, however, the Arabians neglected Latin authors, and
      apparently possessed no knowledge of Celsus or Coelius Aurelianus. As
      religious prejudices prohibited dissections, they were obliged<span
      class="pagenum">066</span><a name="link066" id="link066"></a> to rely
      solely upon the anatomical descriptions of Galen, and succeeded in
      increasing the errors of the original by inaccurate translations. So far
      as originality of observation goes, the Arabians were in most respects
      behind the Greeks; nevertheless, they were the first to differentiate
      eruptive fevers, to which the latter paid little or no attention. The
      Arabian school also supplied the knowledge of purgatives, such as cassia
      and manna, which replaced the drastics employed by the ancients; also the
      mode of preparation of syrups, tinctures, distilled waters, pomades, and
      plasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Arabians were gradually rising by their power, intelligence, and
      renown, the Greeks were declining in inverse ratio; the genius, courage,
      and ancient virtues of the latter grew weaker and weaker, until they
      seemed on the verge of extinction. In the medical history of these
      centuries, in all Europe not under Moslem rule, there was but one man
      entitled to mention as an author in medicine,&mdash;viz., John Actuarius,
      the son of one Zacharia. He lived at the close of the thirteenth and the
      beginning of the fourteenth century; was employed at Constantinople, his
      surname being the honorary title of the court-physicians. He is more
      commonly known as Zacharia. Of his life we know little, save that he wrote
      several volumes, for the most part abridgments or commentaries on the
      doctrine of Galen. He laid great stress on the theory of critical days,
      and sustained his views by astronomical hypotheses most ingeniously
      combined. His was the first Greek work in which were mentioned the
      remedies introduced by the Arabians, yet he has not a word to say of
      variola, measles, spina ventosa, and other affections fully described by
      Arabic authors. He held remarkable views concerning the nature of man,
      whom he supposed to be formed by the union of two contrary substances,&mdash;the
      soul and the body; described somewhat elaborately an imaginary plexus of
      veins connected with the digestive<span class="pagenum">067</span><a
      name="link067" id="link067"></a> organs, through which the animal spirits
      were elaborated and purified; also, and quite methodically, for his age,
      he explained the functions of the animal economy and the etiology of
      disease.

      While the clouds that befogged the study of medicine in the Empire of the
      East thus grew heavier and heavier, we must not be blind to the melancholy
      spectacle concerning the provinces composing the Empire of the West.
      Barbarians in swarms, from the forests of Germany and Scandinavia, had
      swept its various portions, pillaging, destroying, and reducing to slavery
      its inhabitants. In southern Europe everything was changed. Each
      generation witnessed some new and unheard-of invader, who demanded his
      share of booty and renown and left a track of desolation behind him. There
      was a brief period of order when Charlemagne reunited under one dominion
      these divers races and seemed to have resuscitated the Western Empire; but
      no sooner was he dead than its elements, being devoid of affinity, broke
      apart. Former vassals, no longer restrained by the firm hand of the
      emperor, made common warfare against his successors and against each
      other, and for several ages there was nothing but a succession of wars and
      invasions. Feudalism gave some sort of character to this military anarchy
      by affording repose and, in a measure, security for those who had hitherto
      been trampled under foot; but learning and the sciences fell into complete
      neglect, and it was with great difficulty that a very small number of men
      found within the pale of the church a limited protection that enabled them
      to devote themselves to the study of medicine and ecclesiastical law. Near
      the end of the eleventh century, however, the enthusiasm of the crusades
      whetted anew the turbulent appetite of the Christian barons, and led these
      lords of western Europe, with their belligerent spirits, to the East, as a
      result of which people hitherto oppressed could breathe more freely. A few
      States recovered their<span class="pagenum">068</span><a name="link068"
      id="link068"></a> independence; some semblance of law was established;
      municipal institutions were organized, and establishments consecrated to
      public use were founded and multiplied; finally, in the course of the
      thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the cloud which covered the face of
      Roman Catholic Europe was in some measure dispersed, and men of talent and
      even genius began to appear upon the scene; everything about them being so
      obscure, they shone like stars in the firmament. In letters, for instance,
      there were Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio; in mathematics, Leonard, of Pisa,
      the first in Europe to understand and employ figures and algebraic
      characters, although Cuvier has claimed this distinction for Gerbert, a
      Benedictine monk of the tenth century, who subsequently became Pope
      Sylvester II. At this time, although in scholastic estimation medicine,
      theology, and philosophy alone were fit to entertain the human mind, the
      natural sciences were not without occasional representatives. Roger Bacon
      was three centuries in advance of scientific reform, and endeavored to
      introduce experimental philosophy, and so fully convinced some of his
      auditors that they subscribed £2000 sterling to provide for the expense of
      his experiments; this was money most happily employed, since it made
      possible a number of important discoveries. It is said that Bacon knew the
      properties of convex and concave lenses, and was the first to conceive of
      the microscope and telescope; his astronomical knowledge led him to demand
      a reform in the calendar, which Gregory XIII carried out three centuries
      later; he had knowledge of gunpowder and its effects, and was, in fact,
      the wizard of his day; but his boldness and originality drew upon him the
      enmity of the church, by which he was persecuted and finally condemned to
      imprisonment for life upon a diet of bread and water, although he was
      ultimately released, in 1266, by Pope Clement IV. He wrote extensively,
      but only fragments of his works exist, since the friars believed<span
      class="pagenum">069</span><a name="link069" id="link069"></a> them tainted
      with witchcraft and prevented their publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before and during the time of Roger Bacon the philosophers were divided
      into two parties, which engaged in very unseemly and unphilosophic strife.
      One was termed the <i>Realist</i>, and believed, with Plato, that ideas
      are self-existent and independent of the mind,&mdash;in other words,
      veritable entities; the other, the <i>Nominalist</i>, held, with
      Aristotle, that general ideas are pure abstractions formed by the mind
      with the aid of sensations received from without, without which they could
      never exist,&mdash;that is, if a being could be imagined without
      sensibilities and the power of sensation, such being would be destitute of
      ideas. These two parties kept up a very active warfare, and enlisted the
      aid of both civil and ecclesiastical authorities, the result being
      persecution of each other, and that general unsatisfactory conflict into
      which theology and metaphysical speculation always force those who indulge
      in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, regarding the condition of medical affairs in the Empire of the West:
      Down to the seventh century, in Rome, there were court-archiaters who were
      attached to the retinues of the nobles, and in each large city popular
      archiaters formed a college charged with sanitary matters, the instruction
      and examination of candidates, and gratuitous services to the poor.
      Although there is little definite information available, it is probable
      that after the ruin of Alexandria much the same medical organization
      obtained in those provinces as continued under the Greek Empire at
      Constantinople. Under Arab sway we know very little of what rules or
      regulations governed instruction in medicine and its practice; and, so
      soon as one of these countries fell under the rule of the Turks, all
      scientific institutions seem to have decayed or been discontinued,&mdash;or,
      as Renouard states it: "If we may judge by what still exists to-day in
      this unfortunate country (Turkey), consumed by the power of ignorance<span
      class="pagenum">070</span><a name="link070" id="link070"></a> and
      despotism, the most complete anarchy followed all older organizations."
    </p>
    <p>
      In southern Europe, however, things had not gone on quite so badly,
      although at first barbarous invasion caused everywhere disorder and
      confusion, and the Christian States of the Western Empire yet presented
      after three or four centuries a chaotic condition of affairs. The
      ecclesiastical schools, which were under the care of the church, still
      pursued courses of literary and scientific instruction; in the time of
      Charlemagne, for instance, the colleges of the cathedrals, and even some
      of the monasteries, taught medicine in a very limited way under the name
      of physics. Thus all the liberal professions&mdash;that of medicine
      included&mdash;fell under the domination of the clergy, and priests,
      abbots, and bishops became court-physicians. The monks of Mount Cassin, of
      the order of St. Benoit, enjoyed for a long time a great reputation for
      medical skill; and among these in the tenth century was an abbot named
      Berthier Didier, who became Pope Victor III toward the close of the
      eleventh century, and one Constantine, surnamed the African. Of the
      ecclesiastics who from the ninth to the eleventh century were
      distinguished by the knowledge of medicine, there were Hugues, abbot of
      St. Denis, physician to the King of France; Didon, abbot of Sens; Sigoal,
      abbot of Epernay; Archbishop Milo, etc. Even several religious orders of
      women undertook, to a certain extent, the practice of medicine, and
      Hildegarde, who was abbess of the convent of Rupertsburg, near Bingen, is
      credited with having written a treatise on <i>Materia Medica</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the ninth to the thirteenth century the Jews shared with the clergy
      the monopoly of the healing art. Many of these studied under Arabian
      physicians, and, though the canons of the church forbade them to in any
      way minister to the ailments of Christians, they were still called upon in
      time of need, and even in many instances had access to the palaces of
      archbishops, cardinals, and popes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The education<span class="pagenum">071</span><a name="link071" id="link071"></a>
      of Christian priests and infidel practitioners embraced really very
      little, and consisted, for the most part, of knowledge of a few symptoms
      and possession of a few receipts; books were excessively rare and
      expensive, capable teachers lacking, and a good medical education out of
      the question. There was no law nor public regulation which concerned the
      practice of medicine, and any who desired could enter upon it; while
      besides the priests and the Jews&mdash;which latter stood at the top of
      the scale&mdash;there was a multitude of charlatans of the lowest order,
      such as barbers, keepers of baths, and even a few women. The morality of
      this vulgar herd was on a level with its knowledge. I have said the
      practice of medicine was not regulated by law, yet Theodoric, King of the
      Visigoths, enacted a statute that no physician should bleed a woman of
      noble birth without the assistance of a relative or domestic; that if a
      physician in treating a patient or dressing a wound happened to harm a
      gentleman he should pay a forfeit of one hundred sous, and if the patient
      died from the operation he should be handed over to the relatives of the
      deceased, who could do with him whatever they pleased; while if he
      crippled or caused the death of a serf, he was to be held accountable only
      for the loss, and compelled to supply another. This remained in force from
      the sixth to the twelfth century, and was made to apply chiefly to the
      practice of surgery, which had been abandoned to individuals of the lowest
      condition. The practice of internal medicine was, for the principal part,
      the privilege of the clergy, and it is not likely the secular power ever
      expected that one protected with the title of priest should be handed over
      to the relatives of the dead. It furthermore appears that the practice of
      medicine as divorced from surgery led to such irregularities in the
      manners and conduct of the clergy that from the twelfth century popes and
      councils of the church repeatedly forbade the medical art to those in holy
      orders or under vows; but that this prohibition<span class="pagenum">072</span><a
      name="link072" id="link072"></a> was often violated is shown by the
      frequent reiteration of inhibitory laws. During the twelfth century the
      secular authority was also affected by abuses. Roger, founder of the
      kingdom of Sicily, one of the first Christian princes of the Middle Ages,
      gave special attention thereto, and in 1140 proclaimed that every one who
      wished to practice medicine must present himself before a magistrate and
      obtain authorization, under pain of imprisonment and confiscation of
      goods. Other sovereigns followed this example, and regulating ordinances
      were gradually established, which ultimately led to the institution of
      medical faculties and university degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Middle Ages, in the Empire of the West, arose the School of
      Salernum, which became so celebrated that, like that of Alexandria, it
      deserves special mention. The modern city of Salerno is situated on the
      Neapolitan Gulf, about thirty miles southeast of the city of Naples, with
      a population of but a few thousand souls. The ancient city stood upon a
      height in the rear of the present town, where the ruins of its mediaeval
      citadel are still to be seen. It first appeared in history 194 B.C., when
      a Roman colony was founded, was a municipal town of importance, and
      appears even at this early day to have been a health resort, since Horace
      informs us he had been advised to substitute its cool baths for the warm
      ones of Baiæ. During the stormy centuries following the downfall of the
      Western Empire, Salerno successively submitted to the sway of the Goths,
      Lombards, Franks, Saracens, and Greeks, as the vicissitudes of Avar
      compelled. Under the Lombards it became the residence of the Duke of
      Benevcntum, and, in 1075, when taken by Robert Guiscard of Normandy, it
      fell to the crown of Naples, in consequence of which in the fourteenth
      century, the heir apparent of this kingdom took the title of Prince of
      Salernum.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Middle Ages here flourished a medical school, important not
      alone because of its celebrity at the time, but<span class="pagenum">073</span><a
      name="link073" id="link073"></a> for its effect upon the medical history
      of the future. Its origin is obscure, though it has been ascribed to
      Charlemagne in 802; again, its founding has been held to be the work of
      fugitives from Alexandria when that city was captured by the Saracens, 640
      A.D.; some attribute it to the Benedictine order of monks, others to
      Saracens, etc. The foundation by Alexandrian fugitives is probably
      conjectural, yet it must be admitted there is some evidence of knowledge
      of Arabian medicine in Salernum as early as this. Be the origin what it
      may, it is certain that the Benedictine monks exercised a very important
      influence upon this school, and there is considerable reason to think that
      it was really originated by them. Their monastery of Monte Casino was
      located about fifty miles the other side of Naples, occupying the site of
      an ancient temple of Apollo; the rules of the order enjoined the care of
      the sick and treatment by prayer, and St. Benedict himself was credited
      with performing miraculous cures. The rules which forbade public
      instruction were gradually discarded, for in the ninth century Abbot
      Bertharius wrote two books on the art of healing, and by the tenth century
      Monte Casino had acquired great reputation as a medical school, and was
      sought by medically-inclined monks from all quarters. A little later
      (1022) King Henry II, of Bavaria, Emperor of Germany, is said to have been
      cut for stone by St. Benedict himself, who appeared in ghostly form and
      operated with such skill that on awaking the royal patient found the
      calculus in his hand, and only the cicatrix of the wound through which it
      had been removed. Of course, the grateful emperor could do no less than
      richly endow the monastery, and bestow upon it additional privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiderius, the Benedictine abbot from 1058 to 1086, and in the eleventh
      century promoted to the papal chair under the title of Victor III, was
      distinguished for his attainments in medicine and in music, and founded a
      new hospital in connection with the monastery; he also composed four<span
      class="pagenum">074</span><a name="link074" id="link074"></a> books
      detailing the miraculous cures wrought by his patron saint. It was really
      within this monastery that Constantine the African, one of the most
      learned men and the most famous Christian physician of his time, compiled
      his numerous medical treatises.
    </p>
    <p>
      About Constantine there is much of romance. He was born in Carthage in
      1018 and died in 1085. He visited all the prominent schools of his day in
      Egypt, Bagdad, Babylon, and even India, and for thirty-nine years pursued
      the various branches of knowledge away from home. Returning to Carthage,
      misunderstood and feared, he was accused of practicing sorcery and
      compelled to fly to save his life. Disguised as a beggar he escaped to
      Salernum, which had been recently captured by Robert Guiscard, and on the
      recommendation of some royal visitor, who had known him at another court,
      he was made private secretary to Guiscard. His new duties soon became
      irkscme, however, and he retired to a cloister to devote himself to
      literary labors. These, for the most part, were translations of Greek and
      Arabic writings, often made <i>verbatim</i> and without credit. Whatever
      may be said about this lack of honesty, and the barbaric nature of his
      Latin, credit must be given him for reviving the study of Hippocrates and
      Galen in France; and he is generally credited with being the first to
      introduce into Europe knowledge of Arabian medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Monte Casino the Benedictines at an early day spread to Salernum,
      where, by the middle of the tenth century, three monasteries were
      established, in all of which were kept holy relics. It now appears that,
      although there may have been some previous institution of learning at this
      point, and possibly even medical teachers, the real organization of a
      regular school of medicine was due to the Benedictines. In the annals of
      Naples of the middle of the ninth century the names of Salernian
      physicians are mentioned; and it is known that toward the close of the
      tenth century<span class="pagenum">075</span><a name="link075" id="link075"></a>
      Archbishop Verdun visited Salernum for relief from vesical calculus, and
      there died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest medical writings of this school which have been preserved are
      found in the <i>Compendium Salernitanum</i>, discovered in manuscript form
      in 1837; and among the more prominent authors quoted are: Petronius, who
      wrote about 1035; Gariopontus, who wrote about 1040; Bartholomæus,
      Ferrarius, and Affiacius,&mdash;the latter a disciple of Constantius
      Africanus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preaching of Peter the Hermit, which marked the close of the eleventh
      century, was followed by an outburst of crusading enthusiasm that quickly
      converted Europe into a vast camp, and Salernum, being situated upon the
      highroad to the East, was benefited in no small degree and its reputation
      as a medical school materially enhanced; likewise its teachers gained in
      experience as regards military surgery. In this way it became a favorite
      resort for crusaders when disabled, wounded, or diseased. Robert of
      Normandy, son of the conqueror, returning from the Holy Land, remained
      here for some time with a poisoned wound in the arm, received in 1097 at
      the siege of Jerusalem, and it was decided it could be healed only by
      sucking out the poison, a process deemed dangerous to the operator.
      History declares that Robert's wife, daughter of Goeffrey, Earl of
      Conversana, being denied permission, took advantage of her husband's
      unconsciousness during sleep to withdraw the poison, when the wound
      speedily healed. At the time of the departure of Robert, hastened by the
      death of his brother William, John of Milan, the then chief of the medical
      school, presented him with the famous <i>Regimen Sanitatis Salerni</i>,
      said to have been composed largely for Robert's benefit. This was a Latin
      poem that enjoyed most unexampled popularity for many generations, and was
      the <i>vade mecum</i> of well-educated physicians for centuries. It is
      said to have passed through two hundred and forty different editions, and
      that more than one hundred manuscript<span class="pagenum">076</span><a
      name="link076" id="link076"></a> copies are to-day to be found in various
      European libraries. The latest English version was published by Professor
      Ordronaux in 1871. A sample is here submitted:&mdash;

    <p>
      During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the glory of the School of
      Salerno reached its zenith; it was the most famous school of medicine in
      Europe, and was fostered by various kings. The celebrated Jew, Benjamin of
      Tudela, traveling from Spain to India, visited Salernum in 1164, and
      called it the "principal university of Christendom." Early in the twelfth
      century flourished Cophon, Archimatheus, and Nicholas, surnamed
      Præpositus, all of whom were distinguished teachers. The latter published
      a work known as <i>Antidotarium</i>, which was for several centuries the
      standard pharmacopoeia, and which contained a table of weights that
      corresponded very closely to those of the modern apothecary. The younger
      Cophon, who has been confounded with his father (as both seem to have
      written extensively), wrote two treatises,&mdash;one on the anatomy of the
      hog, the other entitled <i>Ars Medendi</i>. The first is interesting as
      the only anatomical treatise of this school which has been preserved, and
      is an index of the degradation of anatomical science of that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of John and Matthew Platearius are of frequent occurrence in the
      records of this school, and have given rise to considerable confusion; the
      former is supposed to have<span class="pagenum">077</span><a name="link077"
      id="link077"></a> been the husband of Trotula, a female physician, of whom
      I shall have more to say later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernard the Provincial, who seems to have escaped the notice of most
      historians, wrote about 1155, and his commentary offers much interesting
      information concerning the therapeutics of the day; he formulated a large
      number of recipes to enable the sick to escape the omnipotence of the
      apothecaries, and recommended wine for the delicate stomachs of the more
      exalted of the clergy, and, inasmuch as these stomachs did not bear
      medicine well, he directed, in accordance with the practice of Archbishop
      Æfanus, that emetics should be prescribed <i>after</i> meals, when their
      action is less injurious and more agreeable; he advised young men and
      women tormented with love which they could not gratify to tie their hands
      behind their backs and drink water from a vessel in which a red-hot iron
      had been cooled. Indeed, his work is full of curious information and
      advice, and is not without therapeutic interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A name which figures largely in the history of this school is that of
      Magister Salernus, about which there is great uncertainty; it is not
      positively known whether this refers to a particular person or is a
      generic name covering various individuals. The name has been mentioned as
      that of one of the four reputed founders of the school; it is positive
      that there are certain treatises which bear this name, which give an
      appearance of authenticity to it as an individual title.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the latter half of the twelfth century lived John of St. Paul, one of
      the teachers of Gilbert the Englishman; also Musandinus, who left a
      curious treatise on dietetics; and Urso, who wrote on the pulse and on the
      urine. Here in 1190 resided and studied a certain Alcadinus, from
      Syracuse, whose knowledge of philosophy and medicine was such that he
      acquired great reputation, and was made a professor; he even composed
      Latin medical poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at the close of this century flourished Ægidius, who studied<span
      class="pagenum">078</span><a name="link078" id="link078"></a> at Salernum,
      and also at Montpellier, where a school of medicine had been founded in
      1180; he was physician to Philip Augustus, of France, and became professor
      in the University of Paris. Three treatises, all in Latin hexameter, are
      ascribed to him. A contemporary was Johanes Rogerus, of Palermo, a
      graduate of Salernum and author of several works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the thirteenth century flourished Roger of Parma, one of the most
      distinguished of the alumni of this school and the earliest pioneer in
      modern surgery; his work on this topic, familiarly known as <i>Rogeriana</i>,
      enjoyed the greatest reputation in its day, and was for a long time the
      surgical text-book of Italy; his predilection for poultices and moist
      dressings in the treatment of wounds, abscesses, and ulcers became, in the
      hands of his successors, the distinguishing feature of the surgery of
      Salernum in opposition to the school at Bologna, where Hugo Di Lucca and
      Theo-doric (his great rival) contended for the superiority of the dry
      treatment. Roger was also the first to use the term <i>seton</i>, and to
      give practical demonstration to this means of derivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland of Parma, a pupil of Roger, and a surgeon of great distinction,
      became professor at Bologna, and wrote a treatise on surgery, which was,
      for the most part, a commentary on the works of his master. The treatise
      of Roger and that of Roland furnished the basis for a work entitled <i>The
      Treatise of the Four Masters</i>, supposed to have been written about
      1270, and manuscripts of which have been long known in various European
      libraries. It is divided into four books, displays no little surgical
      ability, and from its title would appear to have been the joint
      composition of four teachers; indeed, it was long attributed to
      Archimatheus, Platearius, Petro Cellus, and Affiacius, though it is now
      pretty generally understood to be the product of but a single pen and its
      author most likely a Frenchman. The ascription of authorship to four
      masters was probably for the purpose<span class="pagenum">079</span><a
      name="link079" id="link079"></a> of increasing its weight and authority,
      and it constituted a reliable exposition of the surgery of Salernum in its
      day. It is quoted quite freely by Guy de Chauliac, who was the restorer of
      French surgery in the fourteenth century, and occasionally by later
      writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of the distinguished Salernian physicians of the thirteenth
      century, one highly esteemed by Frederick II, was John of Procida, who
      also was active in producing&mdash;if not the real author of&mdash;the
      massacre of the Sicilian Vespers, A.D. 1282. In a dispute concerning the
      question of the two Sicilies he embraced the cause of Prince Manfred, for
      which he was banished by Charles of Anjou, and took refuge at the court of
      Peter III, of Arragon, by whom he was created a baron; and he was
      influential in persuading the latter to assert his claim to the throne of
      Sicily. By various intrigues at different courts he succeeded in
      organizing an alliance, which betrayed its existence in this massacre, and
      finally resulted in the overthrow of the French in Sicily and the transfer
      of the island to the crown of Spain. He was author of at least two
      treatises devoted to medicine and philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other writers of the School of Salernum were: a learned Jew of Agrigentum
      known as "Farragus," Matthew Sylvaticus, Graphæus, and Cappola. About the
      middle of the fifteenth century flourished Saladino, famous as an
      authority on materia medica.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of no small interest that now, for the first time in history, women
      began to figure somewhat prominently as writers, practitioners, and even
      teachers of medicine. About the middle of the eleventh century appeared a
      work, entitled <i>De Midierium Passionibus</i>, attributed to the
      before-mentioned Trotula, wife of John Platearius, which has descended
      even to these days. There is nothing in the work to indicate the name or
      sex of the author, who is invariably spoken of in the third person;
      consequently Trotula's connection therewith has often been disputed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It mentions<span class="pagenum">080</span><a name="link080" id="link080"></a>
      a certain "<i>aqua mirabilis</i>" composed largely of brandy, which spirit
      is said to have first been employed medicinally by Thaddeus of Florence,
      who died in 1295; there is also an account of a patient who <i>wore
      spectacles!</i> The diseases of women and children are also largely dealt
      with. The work is undoubtedly an anonymous production of the eleventh
      century, disfigured by additions of a later day, and ascribed to Trotula,
      perhaps, because of the celebrity that attached to her; at all events, it
      is the earliest work ascribed to a female physician, and thus possesses
      special claims to interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later we read of Sichelguada, wife of Robert Guiscard and a graduate of
      Salernum, who endeavored to poison her step-son, Bohemond, in order to
      secure the succession of her own child. This infamous plot was furthered
      by some of the Salernian physicians, and thwarted only by the prompt
      action of Guiscard, who swore he would slay his wife with his own sword
      should the malady of Bohemond prove fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain other female physicians of this period are mentioned, notably
      Abella, who, in spite of the modesty that is supposed to hedge about her
      sex, produced in Latin hexameter a work entitled <i>De Natura Seminis
      Hominis</i>. Mercuriolus, in the fifteenth century, produced treatises on
      the cure of wounds, pestilent fevers, and on the nails. The most
      celebrated of all, however, appears to have been Calenda, who lived during
      the reign of that notorious profligate, John II, of Naples (1414-1435),
      and who was particularly distinguished for her personal attractions. She
      graduated with great honor from the school at Salernum, and soon after, in
      1423, married a nobleman of the court, which perhaps accounts for the fact
      that she never exercised the privilege of authorship. A little later,
      Marguerite, of Sicily or Naples, also a Salernian graduate, acquired an
      extended professional reputation, and was licensed to-practice by
      Ladislaus, King of Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daremberg<span class="pagenum">081</span><a name="link081" id="link081"></a>
      informs us that there were numerous female physicians at Salernum, much
      sought after because of their talents, and, moreover, highly esteemed by
      the professors of the school, who freely quoted the writings of their fair
      pupils and contemporaries; further, that they employed ointments in
      paralyses; fumigations, vapors, and antimony for coughs; and lotions of
      aloe and rose-water for swellings of the face; they combined scientific
      knowledge with facetious playfulness in a manner peculiar to the sex, in
      that they tendered unsuspecting beaux bouquets of roses doctored with
      powdered euphorbium, and hugely enjoyed the forced sternutations of their
      victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will thus be seen what a wide-spread and long-continued influence the
      school of Salernum exerted. At first physics and philosophy were the
      principal branches taught, but later the other sciences were cultivated.
      The Emperor Frederick II united the different schools of the city into a
      university,&mdash;a term, however, that, as then applied, appears to have
      corresponded to what in the nineteenth century is understood by <i>corporation</i>.
      The emperor likewise published several decrees which revised the duties
      and privileges of practitioners of medicine and surgery in his kingdom,
      and, in 1224, ordered that no person should practice within the two
      Sicilies until examined by the faculty of the university and licensed at
      the royal hands; further, practitioners were compelled to devote at least
      one year to the study of anatomy. The faculty at this time consisted of
      ten professors, whose salary probably depended upon the number of pupils.
      A candidate for graduation was required to present proof of majority, of
      legitimacy of birth, and of proper duration of preliminary study, and then
      was examined publicly in the <i>Synopsis</i> of Galen, the <i>Aphorisms</i>
      of Hippocrates, or the Canon of Avicenna. On passing he swore to conform
      to all the regulations hitherto observed in medicine, to give gratuitous
      treatment to the poor, and to expose all apothecaries detected<span
      class="pagenum">082</span><a name="link082" id="link082"></a> in
      adulterating drugs. A book was then placed in his hands, a ring upon his
      finger, and a laurel crown upon his head, when he was "dismissed with a
      kiss." The degree conferred was that of "<i>Magister</i>"&mdash;the modern
      title of Doctor being at that period employed almost exclusively to
      designate a public teacher or professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the watchfulness of King Frederick was not confined alone to the
      regulation of medical study within his kingdom. The number of professional
      visits, and the recompense therefor, were fixed by law. Every physician
      was compelled to visit his patients twice daily, and even once at night as
      well, if summoned, and for this attendance was permitted a daily fee
      equivalent to fourteen cents for patients within the city, while for calls
      without the city the largest legal charge was one dollar and thirteen
      cents, provided he paid his own expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earlier teachings and practice of Salernum were a curious mixture of
      methodism, dogmatism, and superstition. The latter may be better
      understood when it is recalled that the practice of medicine for an
      extended period was confined almost exclusively to ecclesiastics, who by
      their very education were prone to superstition and upheld the efficacy of
      charms and relics, and the active intervention of saints and martyrs as
      well as the myrmidons of evil; hence arose many of the conflicts and
      absurd notions peculiar to the period. The prevalence of the doctrine of
      medical methodism was due to the character of the writings most accessible
      to students of that day,&mdash;such as those of Ccelius Aurelianus and
      others; and it is curious that Celsus, the most elegant of medical
      authors, was never popular among medical monks. The Hellenic language
      having almost disappeared from Italy by the sixth century, the works of
      the Greek authors had become a sealed book to a vast majority, even of the
      better educated; hence the purer sources of medical knowledge were not
      available. Although the school of Salernum, at a later date, prided<span
      class="pagenum">083</span><a name="link083" id="link083"></a> itself upon
      its devotion to the "Father of Medicine," the Hippocratic writings were
      not known at this period; and, when Constantine the African, by the
      translation of Arabian works, introduced a new element into the Salernian
      school, he ingrafted upon its medical teaching a form of doctrine which
      found a congenial atmosphere, in which it throve vigorously, while, a
      century later, the translations of Gerard of Cremona gave a stronger
      impulse to the growth of Hippocratic medicine than to Hippocratic
      doctrine.

      From the <i>Commentary of the Four Masters</i> we learn that Salernian
      practitioners recognized the diagnostic importance of nausea, vomiting,
      and the flow of blood from the ears in injuries to the head; that they
      resorted to the trepan for depressed fractures and the relief of
      intracranial extravasation; that hernia cerebri was treated by pressure
      and caustics; that ligatures, both above and below the opening, were
      applied for the treatment of wounds of the carotid arteries and jugular
      veins. It was advised to decline patients suffering from wounds of the
      heart, lungs, diaphragm, stomach, or liver, in order to avoid the disgrace
      of losing them; and in penetrating wounds of the intestines and in those
      complicated with protrusion of the wounded gut instruction was given how
      to envelop them in the warm abdomen of a slaughtered animal until natural
      color and temperature were restored, and then to insert a cannula of
      alder-wood into the wounded intestine, which was to be neatly closed and
      stitched; finally, the protrusion was to be carefully washed with warm
      water and returned into the abdominal cavity, enlarging the opening for
      this purpose, if necessary. Also was advised the extraction of diseased
      teeth; and the operation of lithotomy was described with considerable
      care. Compound fractures were to be treated with splints. On the whole,
      this commentary of the alleged Four Masters is the most interesting and
      ancient Salernian work which has been<span class="pagenum">084</span><a
      name="link084" id="link084"></a> preserved, and is well worthy the
      attention of even modern surgeons.

      Such was the school of Salernum in its prime, during the twelfth and
      thirteenth centuries. My readers will not have failed to note how few
      names have been mentioned which are prominent in medical history, and how
      few improvements were made in medical art by those who have been
      mentioned. One naturally inquires, then, what was the source of the
      wide-spread fame of Salerno as a school, since it was distinguished
      neither by notable discovery in science nor by celebrated teachers, and
      the predominant element was doubtless one of obstinate conservatism and
      unswerving devotion to ancient doctrines. Founded during the dark period
      of the Middle Ages, at a time when ignorance, bigotry, and superstition
      prevailed, it preserved, amidst the gloom that had settled upon Europe, a
      few rays of that intellectual light which had shown so brightly in the
      golden ages of Roman history. These rays, made more conspicuous by the
      intellectual night which they barely illumined, were a beacon for men who
      were groping for more light. Thus the name of Salernum became synonymous
      with intellectual advancement in later ages. As the parent and model of
      our modern university system, Salernum yet deserves, in a measure, to
      enjoy the esteem of a numerous scholastic offspring. At a time when
      priests were particularly active in passing off rudimentary knowledge for
      the science of healing this school began to secure all information
      possible from the laity for the progressive development of medicine. It
      began, in other words, to hold aloof and then to break away from the
      fetters of a fanatical church. Its decline, too, was as rapid as its
      career had been brilliant. One very serious blow was struck when, in 1224,
      Frederick II founded the University of Naples and forbade Neapolitan
      subjects to seek instruction at any other university. The next year a
      revolt in the city provoked the closure of the schools<span class="pagenum">085</span><a
      name="link085" id="link085"></a> of Bologna, which were, however, opened
      again two years later. Within a short time the universities of Naples,
      Montpellier, Padua, Paris, and Bologna all entered into a contest for
      pre-eminence with a rivalry which was not always generous. In 1224, it is
      said, the latter university had no less than ten thousand students.
      Happily, however, the period of the Renaissance proved to be one of
      emancipation from the fetters of ignorance and superstition, making an
      appeal for liberty which the conservatism of Salernum could not brook.
      Roger Bacon, in England; Lanfranc and Guy de Chauliac, in France; Mondino,
      at Bologna, and Savonarola, at Padua, found no rivals at Salernum to
      successfully contest their fame. Thus this ancient school fell behind the
      age, and in a short time sank into a mediocrity which was scarcely
      brightened by the reflection of a departed glory. In 1342 Robert I renewed
      the decree of Frederick II, which closed all the schools in his kingdom
      save those of Naples, but excepted Salernum solely because of its
      antiquity and the traditions of his predecessors. In 1413 King Ladislaus
      excepted the Salernian alumni and professors from all taxes, duties, and
      tribute. In the middle of the fourteenth century the poet Petrarch speaks
      of the school as a memory of the past; but its last appearance was in
      1748, when a dispute at Paris relating to the rank of physicians and
      surgeons was referred to Salerno's university for arbitration and final
      decision. In 1811 a formal decree reduced this parent of all European
      universities to a mere gymnasium or preparatory school; and now one may
      wander through the streets of the modern town and among the ruins of its
      ancient predecessor and seek in vain to trace some reminder of those who
      were illustrious during some of the most terrible ages in the world's
      history. No echo of tradition, no stone of ancient edifice, no library
      preserving precious manuscripts, not even an edition of the old Salernian
      regimen, in the whole city; in fact, none now so poor as to do it
      reverence.

      class="pagenum">086</span><a name="link086" id="link086"></a> I have taken
      up so much time with an account of the school of Salernum, a few words
      must be devoted to the school of Montpellier, which was second in time and
      in importance among the great influences in the culture of western Europe.
      There was a time when to have studied there lent a special halo of glory,
      for, being near the sea, and in the vicinity of thermal baths, even so
      early as A.D. 1153 it was famous as a school of medicine; moreover, those
      who presided over it did not lapse unconditionally into mediæval
      philosophy, with its bewildering subtleties. It is said to have been
      founded A.D. 738, but first mention of it as a source of medical education
      occurs in 1137, when Bishop Adelbert II, of Mayence, visited the city to
      listen to its medical teachers. A faculty of philosophy was added in 1242,
      and one of law in 1298. Within the walls of the city sojourned both
      Christians and Jews, the latter being subject directly to the civil
      authorities, and particularly esteemed as translators. One of the most
      famous of the sons of Israel was Profatius Judicus, who became a rector of
      the faculty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to 1370, when the university became subject to the kings of France,
      it was under the control of the Pope; and then, as now, the school of
      medicine was the chief ornament of this ancient seat of learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most illustrious and famous pupils of Montpellier<span
      class="pagenum">087</span><a name="link087" id="link087"></a> was that
      religious mystic and alchemistic visionary, Raimond Lull, or Lulli, a
      would-be transmuter of metals and seeker for the philosopher's stone. Born
      in 1234, at the age of thirty he began to see visions, and was thereby
      roused from an atheistic tendency to soon become wonderfully pious;
      ultimately he entered the order of Minorites, studied Arabic, and appeared
      as a missionary in Africa, seeking to convert the Saracens&mdash;who,
      however, declined the honor, and finally (in 1315) rewarded his zeal by
      stoning him to death. Beside works on alchemy and theology, he wrote on
      medical subjects, and, like all great minds of the period, passed among
      the common people as a sorcerer in league with the devil. Nevertheless, he
      was a notable figure in his age and country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite celebrated became the compendium of Gilbert of England (1290), which
      contained the same speculative nonsense, the same polypharmacy, and the
      same superstition as other works of that time; what little it contained of
      value was taken largely from other writers. While this Gilbert, often
      known as Gilbertus Anglicus, was not the first English writer on practical
      medicine, he was the earliest whose works have been preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more famous was John Gaddesden, physician-in-ordinary to the King of
      England, professor in Merton College, Oxford, who wrote the famous
      treatise known as <i>Rosa Anglica</i>, which appeared between 1305 and
      1315. This treatise was characterized by mysticism and disgusting
      therapeutic measures, and tainted by medical avarice, superstition, and
      charlatanry. Gaddesden was, perhaps, the first to formally recommend the
      "laying on of hands" by the king for the cure of scrofula (first performed
      by Edward the Confessor&mdash;1042-1056), whence comes the ancient name
      for this disease,&mdash;i.e., "king's evil." *

      Arnold<span class="pagenum">088</span><a name="link088" id="link088"></a>
      de Villeneuve (1234-1313) studied seven years at Montpellier, twenty years
      at Paris, visited all the universities in Italy, then went to Spain to
      levy on the Arabian authors. He wrote on medicine, theology and especially
      on chemistry&mdash;in which art he obtained great renown both as an author
      and teacher. To him is due the discovery of spirit of wine, oil of
      turpentine, aromatic waters, besides several preparations of less note,
      and the introduction of chemical compounds into therapeutics. His was a
      very stirring life, for he traveled extensively; he became a teacher at
      Bologna, and physician to Peter III, of Arragon. Shortly before his demise
      he went to Paris, having fallen under the ban because of a declaration
      that papal bulls, far from being sacredly inspired, were human works, and
      that acts of charity were dearer to God than hecatombs, etc. He finally
      perished by shipwreck, but the spirit of fanaticism followed him after
      death, for his volumes were condemned by the Inquisition, because they
      commended experiments rather than mere speculations. In spite of his
      general honesty in accordance with the spirit of the times he inculcated
      deceit in medicine, and one of his declarations is: "If thou canst not
      find anything in the examination of the renal secretion, declare that an
      obstruction of the liver exists. Particularly use the word 'obstruction,'
      since it is not understood, and it is of great importance that people
      should not understand what thou say est." He was one of the first to
      administer brandy, which he regarded as the elixir of life&mdash;whence
      the modern <i>Eau de Vie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connected with this school, also, or well known as having studied there,
      were many men whose names became more or less famous&mdash;among them John
      Arden, who settled in London about the middle of the fourteenth century;
      Vinario, a contemporary of Guy de Cliauliac, and the well-known surgeon
      and anatomist Henri de Mondeville, who was a teacher of Guy de Chauliac.
      But an idea of the doctrines prevalent in the medical literature of this
      part of the<span class="pagenum">089</span><a name="link089" id="link089"></a>
      world, at this time, may be had from the fact that most writers chose
      titles for their works after the style of ballad singers: for instance,
      those describing the plague and venereal diseases were called <i>Flowers
      and Lilies of Medicine</i>; the <i>Rosa Anglica</i> of John Gaddesden was
      another example. Matters had arrived at such a pass, indeed, that men of
      science no longer hesitated to confess superstition and mingle it openly
      with deceit, to oppose the interests of the most needy, and to extort from
      their fellow-creatures fees in proportion to their supposed ability to
      pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Charlemagne each cathedral possessed a school in which were
      taught arithmetic, theology, singing, and sometimes medicine; the
      Episcopal College had medical teachers who gave advice and dressed wounds
      at the doors of the Church of Notre Dame, Paris; but when the medical
      profession had been divorced from the sacerdotal by councils and popes,
      many of these cathedral schools closed. In order to preserve the
      jurisdiction which they for a long time had exercised over the learned
      professions, many were erected into universities, and thus the clergy gave
      instruction in philosophy, theology, and later in medicine. During the
      thirteenth century arose many of the great universities in Europe, notably
      those of Bologna, Padua, and Naples, in Italy; of Paris, Montpellier, and
      Toulouse, in France; of Valencia and Tortosa, in Spain; of Oxford, in
      England. Pope Innocent III by papal bull guaranteed that the professors
      and students at Paris should be exempt from all excommunications save
      those which emanated directly from the Holy See; French sovereigns
      conferred many privileges upon the universities, and soon the members of
      the University of Paris formed practically a second city, with its own
      laws, customs, police, citizens, and magistrates. Still, however, all
      science belonged to the clergy, and its teachers, though removed from the
      cloister, were none the less Roman Catholic; so that the popes reigned
      over the people through the parish clergy, and over<span class="pagenum">090</span><a
      name="link090" id="link090"></a> the latter by the clerical teachers and
      professors. Nevertheless, in all candor it must be acknowledged that these
      studious men, thus associated together for mutual instruction and
      emulation in learning, contributed, in a large measure, to elevate
      Christian civilization above all others, though several generations were
      required to secure the results calculated to make men celebrated; hence
      the early periods of the universities developed very few names. Many were
      conspicuous by their love of instruction, but not by originality of
      research. Men undertook expensive and wearisome voyages without
      encouragement or hope of reward, simply to obtain some rare manuscript or
      to hear some renowned professor; and they appeal to us of the nineteenth
      century by their devotion, if not by the results of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the somewhat scattered and more or less eminent men of this period
      was Gerard, of Cremona in Lombardy, a man of great purity and
      studiousness, who arduously pursued all that Latin authors could teach
      him, and, not being able to procure in Italy certain manuscripts which
      dated from the time of Ptolemy, determined to go to Toledo in search of an
      Arabian translation. At this time he was unacquainted with Arabic, but
      soon mastered it, and&mdash;armed with this powerful resource, which no
      other physician had possessed since the time of Constantine the African&mdash;he
      could not see so many Arabic works devoted to all branches of science as
      were gathered at the Spanish University without a desire to translate and
      transmit the same to his own country; hence he gave the remainder of his
      life to this work. He rendered into Latin the treatises of Hippocrates and
      Galen, of Serapion, and of all the famous Arabian authors from the time of
      Phazes, including the <i>Canon</i> of Avicenna and the work on surgery by
      Albucassis. He died at the age of seventy-three, in 1187, at Cremona, and
      left all his books to the monastery of St. Lucy, within whose walls he was
      buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      William<span class="pagenum">091</span><a name="link091" id="link091"></a>
      of Salicet, born at Plaisance in the first years of the thirteenth
      century, became a professor in the University of Bologna, and later at
      Verona. He wrote extensively on medicine, and earned a reputation as a
      surgeon that preserves his fame to the present day. It is claimed that his
      status in medical literature depends, in large measure, upon the fact that
      he was, perhaps, the first to refuse slavish obedience to preceding
      authors, preferring, instead, to draw upon the results of personal study
      and experience. He died in 1280.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanfranc, or Lanfranchi (according to whether one prefers his French or
      Italian name), studied under William of Salicet. Of his early life very
      little is known, save that he practiced surgery in Milan at the time of
      the great dissension between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and, for
      attaching himself to the weaker party, was exiled and forced to seek an
      asylum in France; he resided in Lyons for several years, and here wrote a
      work on minor surgery; in 1295 he went to Paris on the invitation of the
      faculty of medicine, opened a course on surgery which met with great
      success, and then published a second and larger treatise on the subject.
      It is said of him by Malgaigne that, less from his fault perhaps than that
      of his age, after his death (about 1315) surgery began to decline. From
      the time of Brunus, who practiced in Padua in 1250, the barbers had done
      the scarifying and bleeding. After the time of Lanfranchi there were
      others who applied leeches and often cauteries, and even the women meddled
      with surgery and in all operations competed with the barbers; the lay
      surgeons held themselves rivals to the clergy. Lanfranchi inherited from
      his old master, William, an aversion for them all, and often had to
      contend with uneducated and incompetent laymen. Clerical surgeons regarded
      operations as beneath their dignity; and Lanfranchi, who deplored this
      condition of affairs, confessed he had sometimes bled with his own hands,
      but had never operated for ascites, hernia, cataract, or stone.

      John<span class="pagenum">092</span><a name="link092" id="link092"></a>
      Pitard has descended to fame not as a writer, but as the founder of the
      surgical schools of St. Come and St. Damien, which occupy so eminent a
      position in the surgical annals of France. In 1306 he was surgeon to the
      King of France, Philip le Bel, and the sworn surgeon of Chatelet. The
      College of St. Come, in 1311, was only a little brotherhood of
      lay-surgeons, who gradually grew in importance as the result of the
      obstinate struggles sustained,&mdash;on the one hand, against the faculty
      of medicine, and, on the other, against the barber-surgeons. Malgaigne
      has, with great patience and clearness, shown that the importance of this
      body of men has been greatly exaggerated by historians; he has traced
      their various turns of fortune from beginning to end; I shall have
      occasion to consider them again farther on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mondino, sometimes known as Mundinus, born in 1275, became a professor in
      the University of Bologna, and died in 1327. He was the author of a
      celebrated treatise on anatomy, said to have reached twenty-five editions,
      and which was the first of its kind since Galen. This science had been
      greatly neglected; in Salernum, for instance, they were, for a long time,
      contented with the treatise of Copho on the anatomy of the hog, and most
      of the anatomical knowledge of the age was apparently derived from this
      source; Mondino resurrected the study and pursued it with interest and
      enthusiasm, though under the greatest difficulties. His works for more
      than two centuries, along with the writings of Galen and the Arabic
      authors, served for anatomical demonstration, although very incomplete,&mdash;as
      witness the statement:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beneath the veins of the forearm we see many muscles and many large and
      strong cords, of which it is not necessary to attempt the anatomy on such
      a corpse (i.e., a recent one), but on one dried in the sun for three
      years, as I have shown otherwise, in developing the number<span
      class="pagenum">093</span><a name="link093" id="link093"></a> and the
      anatomy of those of the superior and inferior extremity."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, he took the opposite course to discover and demonstrate
      the nerves, and advised maceration in running water. It required almost
      superhuman boldness to substitute demonstrations on the human cadaver for
      those upon swine, yet this was done by Mondino; and at the time the
      prejudice against dissection was so general that for more than a century
      after Mondino&mdash;who died in 1327&mdash;no one dared, at least
      publicly, to emulate his example. It was in the year 1315 that he publicly
      dissected the bodies of two women in Bologna. Anatomical study was further
      complicated at this time by certain bulls of Pope Boniface VIII,
      forbidding evisceration or boiling or cooking any part of the human body;
      these deliverances were really aimed, not against scientific
      investigation, but at the absurd custom introduced by the crusaders of
      cutting up and boiling the bodies of their relatives who died in infidel
      countries, in order to send them home for burial in holy ground;
      nevertheless, the papal injunction certainly operated to discourage and
      prohibit anatomical dissection, since nearly two hundred years later the
      University of Tübingen was obliged to apply to Pope Sixtus IV for
      permission to authorize dissection.
    </p>

      Guy de Chauliac, born in Gévaudan about 1300. was the most famous
      physician and surgeon in Christendom during the Arabic period. He studied
      at the cathedral college of Mende, which at that time was quite
      celebrated, and was taught medicine at Montpellier under the best masters
      of his day. It is probable, also, that he studied in Paris, and certain
      that later, in Bologna, he saw dissections made. Dissatisfaction with the
      writings of the ancients and the knowledge which he obtained at the
      schools stimulated his own powers of observation, and he became, in every
      respect, an original student and acquired a degree<span class="pagenum">094</span><a
      name="link094" id="link094"></a> of erudition far more extended than that
      possessed by any of his contemporaries. He practiced in various places,
      longest at Lyons; and finally entered the service of Pope Clement VI, at
      Avignon, and probably enjoyed the same honor under Innocent V and Urban V;
      when the latter was made pope, in 1362, de Chauliac became his chaplain,
      or chapel-reader. In 1363 he published a work on surgery called <i>The
      Inventory</i>, upon which his fame chiefly rests, though several other
      volumes emanated from his pen. None knew better than he how to unite
      respect for the ancients with justice toward contemporaries, and he cited
      a large number of Greek, Arabian, and Latin authors, some of whom are now
      utterly unknown. The sciences, he declared, are "created by successive
      additions; the same man cannot lay the foundation and perfect the
      superstructure. We are as children carried on the neck of a giant; aided
      by the labors of our predecessors we see all that they have seen, and
      something beside." In tracing the character of a surgeon he recommends
      that he be "learned, expert, ingenious, bold where he is sure, timid when
      in doubt, avoiding bad cures and practices, being gracious to the sick,
      generous and compassionate, wise in prediction, chaste, sober, pitiful,
      and merciful; not covetous nor extortionate, but receiving moderate fees
      according to the circumstances of his patients, the character of the case,
      and his own dignity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never since Hippocrates," says Malgaigne, "has medicine learned a
      language stamped with such nobility and in such few words." Although a
      follower of Galen, in anatomy he insisted on the necessity of dissection,
      and proposed to make use of the corpses of executed criminals for this
      purpose. The drawings made by Henri de Mondeville were known to him; he
      divided abscesses into hot and cold, although among the latter he included
      oedcma, tympanites, dropsy, scirrhus, and other conditions. In practice he
      was more timid, yet more active,<span class="pagenum">095</span><a
      name="link095" id="link095"></a> than Lan franchi, who never cut for
      stone, but left that operation to the traveling surgeons. De Ghauliac
      described it as he had seen it performed; he opened the abdomen for
      dropsy, did not hesitate to attempt the radical cure of hernia, and
      operated for cataract. The plague which raged during the fourteenth
      century and depopulated the known world of one-fourth of its inhabitants,
      twice appeared in Avignon while Guy de Chauliac was a resident there&mdash;and
      he acknowledges that nothing but shame prevented him from fleeing. He
      remained at his post, visited the sick, and was himself attacked and left
      for dead. "In this frightful position he had sufficient presence of mind
      to follow the peculiarities of his case, analyze his own sufferings, and
      to give a description of them worthy of Hippocrates" (Renouard). His work
      soon became the surgical code of Christendom, and was commented upon and
      translated into all tongues, remaining for a long time a classic, and even
      at this day it preserves much of its interest as representing the
      condition of medical science at the close of the Middle Ages; moreover,
      its literary style was much superior to that of any of his contemporaries,
      all of whom wrote very barbarous Latin. He died about 1370.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the death of de Chauliac terminates our interest, not merely in the
      Arabian physicians and those who were intimately connected with them, but
      in the so-called Arabic Period. It may be added, in passing, that the
      followers of Mahomet, like those of Christ, erected by the side of each of
      their mosques a school, and often a hospital, endowed with more or less
      generosity by caliphs or the wealthy, who hoped to purchase redemption and
      eternal happiness by such liberality.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain number of religious orders or communities were established
      during the Middle Ages to give succor to the deserving sick, the most
      widely known being those of St. Mary; St. Lazarus; St. John, of Jerusalem;
      and the Daughters<span class="pagenum">096</span><a name="link096"
      id="link096"></a> of God. To be sure, some, through the endowment of the
      opulent, became rich beyond all reason, and departed from their primitive
      purposes, and thus not only excited the covetousness of monarchs, but had
      even the temerity to resist their authority. This compelled, every now and
      again, a suppression of some order or institution&mdash;partly, perhaps,
      for laxity of morals, and partly because of their turbulence. Of this
      period it may be said that charitable zeal for the sick was never more
      pronounced; princes, bishops, and popes gave examples of devotion by
      dressing with their own hands the ulcers of lepers&mdash;and leprosy was
      in those days a frightful disease, having been contracted by the crusaders
      in the Orient, and everywhere spread as they returned, being, moreover,
      favored by the miserable uncleanliness which was then so common.
      Ignorance, dread, and fear rendered this disease worse than usual, and it
      was confounded with other maladies less formidable. It has been estimated
      that in the fifteenth century Europe harbored no less than nineteen
      thousand lepers; and that the disease was a great terror is manifest by
      the excessive caution taken against its spread: its victims were forbidden
      to enter cities, and on the highway were compelled to stand aside lest
      they should taint passers-by with their breath; even a healthy person
      convicted of being touched by a leper was banished from society; any
      infraction of these rules was punishable by death. It will thus be seen
      what depth of genuine humanity it required to have anything to do with one
      of these outcasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another institution prevailed widely during these days,&mdash;namely,
      public baths, which were established in nearly every city and increased to
      such an extent that in the fifteenth century the bathers of Paris
      constituted a powerful brotherhood, so powerful, in fact, that Jacque
      Despars, physician to Charles VII, and one of the most renowned professors
      of the faculty, for speaking openly against<span class="pagenum">097</span><a
      name="link097" id="link097"></a> the abuse of public baths, was obliged to
      leave the capital to avoid persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      A study of the general history of the Arabic Period reveals that the
      Arabs, previously obscure and uncivilized, emerged rapidly from the
      demi-savage state, and took the first rank among the polished nations of
      the world. During the earliest portion of this period these people were
      religious vandals and destructive fanatics, but later embraced with
      enthusiasm and persistence a study of the humanities, and endeavored to
      repair their early ravages by collecting the <i>débris</i> of the literary
      and scientific monuments of Greece; but, though they cultivated medicine
      with zeal and success, they added little to the Greek treasures. Later,
      Arabia was overrun by hordes from the deserts of Tartary, a people yet
      more barbarous and unknown, who established themselves in all parts of the
      globe then under Saracenic dominion, and by their brutal despotism
      degraded the Arabians to a condition approaching that from which they had
      emerged. This seems to have been ever the result of Turkish conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Greek nation, which was for so many ages at the head of
      civilization, gradually lost its power, virtue, courage, glory, and
      independence, and continued to descend, until now it exercises no
      influence whatever on the course of events. During the course of the
      Arabic Period only one Grecian physician merits mention on account of his
      writings, and in these there was nothing-new except what he had borrowed
      without credit from the Saracens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Empire of the West,&mdash;that is the western part of the ancient
      Roman Empire,&mdash;after subjugation by barbarians from Germany and
      Scandinavia, fell under a cloud whose darkness overwhelmed it. Its people,
      however, gradually received new life by commingling their blood with that
      of the invaders. Later they were able to repulse the Saracens<span
      class="pagenum">098</span><a name="link098" id="link098"></a> who poured
      in upon them from Spain; then they turned their armies against each other,
      and wrought mutual havoc and ruin for several centuries. Again, roused by
      religious fanaticism, as had been the Mohammedans previously, they rushed
      by thousands upon the plains of Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, which had
      been for centuries occupied by the Arabs; and their adventures and
      enterprises, and the new and varied scenes through which they passed, gave
      rise among the "Francs" to some taste for poetry and works of imagination
      During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries governments became more
      stable, liberal institutions were created, the rust of ignorance gradually
      disappeared, and by the end of the Arabic Period there were really
      apparent brilliant streaks of mentality in the horizon of the nations of
      Europe. In this progressive movement the study of medicine shared. In the
      thirteenth century it was worthily represented in Italy, in Paris, and
      became established in Montpellier. Notwithstanding, up to this time
      physicians apparently only knew how to timidly follow in the track of the
      Arabians, and approached little, or not at all, in their studies, the
      purer lore of the Greeks.
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE AGE OF RENOVATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This Age of Renovation (extending from the commencement of the fifteenth
      century to the present time, according to Renouard's classification) is
      divided into the Erudite Period, comprising the fifteenth and sixteenth
      centuries, and the Reform Period, comprising the seventeenth and
      eighteenth centuries, and one should add, in fact, the nineteenth. In
      general literature this age is known as that of the Renaissance, and is
      one of whose beginning a great deal has been written, and so much better
      than I can put it in this brief work, that to general sources I should
      perhaps refer those who are interested in knowing how and why there came
      about such a tremendous<span class="pagenum">099</span><a name="link099"
      id="link099"></a> change in methods and habits of thought and in
      acquirement of knowledge. But it is the history of medicine that at this
      time we particularly desire, and our minds must be, in some slight degree,
      prepared for the great changes to be recounted by some, with the
      conditions which brought about this revolution. It was truly an awakening
      in every department of knowledge and along every line of study; it was as
      if the minds of men had been dormant and lost their power of receptivity,
      and, after a long period of torpor, awakened in a new atmosphere amid new
      surroundings; as if there had burst upon them a sudden appreciation of
      ability to do things hitherto undreamed of, and to acquire knowledge such
      as hitherto had been possessed by none. Once free from the shackles
      imposed by authority of the past, these minds severed their Gothic bonds,
      and started forth in every direction with the ardor of youth and the
      interest of novelty, all engaging in the general enterprise of erecting
      from the <i>débris</i> of antique science a new temple to the mind in
      which to worship. While some delved among the records of the past, others
      sought to bind the past and present, and others, bolder yet, cut entirely
      loose from it, rejected all tradition, and would fain have built this
      temple with entirely new materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what led to this sudden awakening? Was it chance, or the effect of
      certain causes which had long been operating'? It has been seen that
      hospitals and various institutions, whose foundations were dedicated to
      humanity, were erected in all parts of Europe; that gradually there had
      come about a better social organization; that there had been a diminution
      of conflicts between princes and their vassals, and the relations between
      the two were more nearly at an equilibrium. Moreover, the invention of the
      compass, which rendered long voyages less dangerous and more frequent,
      opened up to trade regions hitherto inaccessible or unknown, and attracted
      interest toward commerce as a means of pecuniary gain. The telescope had
      been invented, and<span class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100"
      id="link100"></a> astronomy was able to seize upon some of the facts by it
      revealed, and thereby to make more interesting calculations concerning the
      motions of celestial bodies, and attain a knowledge of our solar system
      and its laws. Gradually the microscope shed light upon the hitherto
      unseen; engraving on copper had added its power of illustration to the
      works of the great writers as they appeared; but above all, that which
      brought about this condition of affairs was the discovery of the art of
      printing. The first attempts in this direction were made between the years
      1435 and 1440, and by the united efforts of three men, whose names deserve
      mention so long as their art persists,&mdash;namely, Guttenberg, Faust,
      and Shoeffer. Thanks to them, the same information could be multiplied in
      manifold form and transmitted to all parts of the civilized globe. In this
      way intelligence and reason become triumphant; thenceforward the dominion
      of brute force was broken, and knowledge, because capable of
      dissemination, became imperishable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the commencement of the Erudite Period Arabic literature still
      predominated in medicine. Rhazes, Haly-Abbas, and Avicenna were
      universally invoked and explained. But a taste for Greek literature began
      to prevail in the universities of Italy, and was finally extended to every
      part of Europe, especially after the taking of Constantinople by Mahomet
      II, Emperor of the Turks, in 1453. This disaster, which at first bade fair
      to be a mortal blow to Greek literature and language, strange to say,
      served only to hasten their resurrection in the Occident. Constantinople
      having been given over to pillage at this time, most of its learned men
      escaped, carrying with them all manuscripts that could be seized; most of
      these found refuge in Italy, and enlightened protectors in the allpowerful
      prince of the house of Medici, in Florence, in the popes at Rome, and in
      Alphonso, of Arragon, King of Naples and Sicily. Everywhere these
      fugitives spread the knowledge<span class="pagenum">101</span><a
      name="link101" id="link101"></a> of the masterpieces of Greek literature
      and art, and in this way a taste for books, libraries, and sound erudition
      was diffused, while the Greek and Latin classics were hunted up and
      published with great patience and ardor; thus the works of the old writers
      were edited, translated, commented upon, and everywhere disseminated
      throughout Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who devoted themselves to the thankless task of editing, and
      purifying from interpolations, the works of the classic writers was
      Nicholas Léonicenus, born near Vincenza in the year 1428, who studied
      medicine at Padua and taught it for more than sixty years at Ferrara. He
      possessed great vigor of mind, with purity of manners and serenity of
      soul, and was the first to translate directly from Greek into Latin the
      aphorisms of Hippocrates and portions of the writings of Galen. He
      combated in every way the infatuation of his contemporaries for the
      Arabians and their lore, and called attention to many of the errors of men
      who, like Pliny the naturalist, had fallen for lack of fully understanding
      the Greek authors they compiled. At the ripe age of ninety-six he died,
      regretted by all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Linacre, of Canterbury, a contemporary of Léonicenus, though
      younger (1461-1524), studied first at the University of Oxford, went to
      Italy in 1484, and in Florence attracted the attention of Lorenzo de
      Medici, who made him the companion of his own children, to whom he gave
      the best possible advantages. In due time he returned to England, where
      his talents speedily won him high station, and he became physician to King
      Henry VIII, and later to Queen Mary. Linacre was the first Englishman, it
      is said, who spoke purely the language of the Romans. He translated
      several books of Galen that are still esteemed; and caused the founding of
      two chairs, one at Oxford, the other at Cambridge, whose incumbents were
      charged with the duty of explaining the works of Hippocrates<span
      class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a> and Galen.
      But he is most entitled to the gratitude of his countrymen for his
      influence in founding the College of London. To appreciate properly its
      importance and his merits, we must remember the obstacles that had to be
      surmounted; for at that time bishops alone had the right to accord, in
      their own dioceses, permission to practice medicine, and, consequently,
      the healing art was abandoned entirely to monks and illiterate empirics.
      It was well that Linacre had influence at court, else he could never have
      obtained the reform of such overwhelming abuses; but he triumphed in spite
      of powerful opposition, and secured the issue of letters patent which
      prohibited the practice of medicine by any one who had not received a
      degree in one of the two universities in the kingdom, and been examined by
      the President of the College of London assisted by three others. This was
      the achievement which gave this learned man the title of "Restorer of
      Medicine" in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Léonicenus and Linacre, who were of the early Erudite Period, also merit
      mention not merely because of literary talents, but because they were the
      first eminent physicians to embrace the study of Greek classics, and to
      propagate the knowledge therein contained. Subsequently others followed
      the same course,&mdash;too many, in fact, to be enumerated; but it was
      easy to follow after such leaders. From the time when men began to realize
      the superiority of Greek models over prolix Arabian commentaries, they
      were anxious to seek the light at its source, and applied themselves with
      avidity to the study of the originals. At this time copies of Greek
      authors were few in number and in a deplorable condition, owing to
      neglect. To rediscover them, to purify, to eliminate what was not
      original, to rearrange, and finally to multiply by the aid of the
      printing-press was an extended labor requiring great knowledge, rare
      sagacity, and commendable patience. One of the greatest publications in
      medical literature belonging to this epoch was a complete edition of the
      Hippocratic writings, translated<span class="pagenum">103</span><a
      name="link103" id="link103"></a> into Latin by Anuce Foes,&mdash;a poor,
      but learned, practitioner, who lived on the products of his business as
      pension physician in the city of Metz,&mdash;and issued from
      Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1495. To this master-work Foes consecrated forty
      years of his life. Another treatise belonging to this same time, less
      important, perhaps, from a medical point of view, but nevertheless showing
      great erudition, was a treatise on the gymnastics of the ancients, by <i>Jerome
      Mercurial</i> is, a work said to be not less precious to historians than
      antiquarians. It was by such intense zeal and hard labor that true
      erudition was restored in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following now some of the special branches of medical learning and their
      development, let us look first at anatomy and physiology. I have already
      related the salient points of the life and labors of Mondino, of whom it
      is said that, about the year 1315, while professor at Bologna, he
      dissected the bodies of two women, and shortly after published an epitome
      of anatomy illustrated with wood-cuts. Also has been mentioned the
      prohibition of anatomical study pronounced by Pope Boniface VIII, in 1300.
      It was only toward the close of the fifteenth and the early years of the
      sixteenth century that this prejudice began to abate; the popes, who then
      stood at the head of scientific movements, withdrew their interdictions,
      and the universities of Italy gave public dissections. Achillini,
      Benedetti, and Jacques Berenger dissected at Bologna, Padua, and Pavia,
      previous to the year 1500; soon afterward their example was generally
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacques Dubois, whose name was Latinized into Jacobus Sylvius, was born in
      1478, in a village near Amiens; he studied in Paris, where he worked most
      industriously at anatomy, which later he was so successful in teaching. He
      was the first to arrange all the muscles of the human body, to determine
      their functions, and to give names to those of them which had not yet been
      so designated. He discovered<span class="pagenum">104</span><a
      name="link104" id="link104"></a> the valves of the large veins, and was
      the first to study the blood-vessels by means of colored injections. He
      gave the same careful attention to pharmacy, and in Paris, before a large
      class of students, began lectures, on anatomy, physiology, hygiene,
      pathology, and therapeutics; these he continued until the faculty, on
      account of jealousy, interrupted them. He then, in 1529, went to
      Montpellier, but returned two years later to become a member of the
      faculty, and once more lectured with the greatest eclat. Later yet he
      became a successor to Vidius in the Royal College,&mdash;a position he
      retained up to his death in 1555. His medical writings were extensive and
      marked by great accuracy, while for anatomy he did a great deal,
      contributing much to popularize it. He dissected a great number of animals
      and as many human cadavers as he could procure, the number, however, being
      small. Unfortunately, he subordinated all his own research to the
      authority of Galen, being himself among those anatomists who permitted
      themselves to be so far misled.

    <p>
      The man of genius and courage, who accepted the truth of what his eyes
      revealed to him, and who was the true reformer in anatomy, was Andreas
      Vesalius, born at Brussels, in 1514, of a family already illustrious in
      medicine. He studied at the University of Louvain, where he early revealed
      the inclinations of the anatomist, since in his leisure moments he was
      wont to amuse himself in dissecting small animals. Near Louvain was a
      place where criminals were executed; and Vesalius, having observed the
      body of one from which the soft parts had all been cleaned away by
      ravenous birds, only the bones and ligaments remaining, detached the
      extremities separately, and then carried off the trunk by night, thus
      possessing himself of his first skeleton. Attracted by the fame of
      Sylvius, lie afterward went to Paris to become his pupil, but, not content
      with the lessons of his master, continued to observe for himself. On the
      hill Montfauçon, where executions<span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a> took place, he disputed with dogs and
      vultures for the remains of criminals, or by stealth disinterred bodies
      from the cemeteries at the greatest personal risk. So great was his
      application that his progress became rapid, and at the age of twenty he
      gave instruction to fellow-students; at twenty-two he became Professor of
      Anatomy at Padua, being appointed by the Senate of Venice; at twenty-nine
      he issued his great work on anatomy, which showed a completeness that left
      far in the rear all that had hitherto been published on this subject. The
      following year he was called by the Emperor Charles V to the court of
      Madrid, then the most brilliant in Europe, where he became the first
      physictan, and from this time abandoned his anatomical labors.<span

      He was the first who dared to dispute the words of Galen and point out his
      errors,&mdash;to ascertain that the greater<span class="pagenum">107</span><a
      name="link107" id="link107"></a> part of Galen's descriptions, having been
      made from monkeys, did not correctly represent human anatomy. This
      audacity raised a crowd of vehement opponents, the least reasonable and
      most fanatic being his old master, Sylvius; but even these onslaughts
      could not conceal the truth. The minds of men generally were ripe for the
      revolution whose signal-fire was thus lighted, and no sooner did Vesalius
      appeal from the decision of Galen to observation of nature than a crowd of
      anatomists were ready to follow his method. He died in 1564.

      Columbus, born at Cremona in 1490,&mdash;succeeded him.<span
      class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108" id="link108"></a> Columbus
      criticised, in some respects, the statements of his eminent predecessor,
      which he could better do, since he is said to have dissected fourteen
      bodies every year, as well as to have practiced venesection. He came so
      near to discovering the mystery of the circulation that it is strange how
      he could have missed it. He even appreciated the systole and diastole of
      the heart and the connection thereof with dilatation and contraction of
      the arteries. He knew, also, that the pulmonary veins conducted arterial
      blood, and that the pericardium was a shut sac. He even appreciated the
      lesser circulation, since he described how the blood left the right side
      of the heart and passed into the lungs, and came back through the veins
      into the left ventricle; because of this discovery, and in spite of his
      utter failure to appreciate the greater circulation, he has been by some
      regarded as entitled to the credit which is universally given to Harvey.
      From his position as teacher in Padua Columbus was called to Pisa, and
      from Pisa to Rome, where he died in 1559.

      Another of the great anatomists of this period, second only in fame to
      Vesalius, was Eustachius, born about the beginning of the sixteenth
      century. He became physician to the Duke of Urbino, and in Rome a city
      physician and professor of anatomy, continuing to teach in the latter city
      until<span class="pagenum">109</span><a name="link109" id="link109"></a>
      overtaken by his final sickness. He was a defender of Galen rather than an
      opponent, and sought to shelter his reputation from the attacks of
      Vesalius. In his praise it must be said that, for his day, he was a great
      anatomist; his chief discoveries were in the domain of comparative
      anatomy. He brought to bear upon his work a knowledge of embryology which
      enabled him, for instance, to describe the kidneys and the teeth much more
      accurately than would otherwise have been possible; he noted, also the
      pathological changes in bodies dissected, and is brought daily to our
      minds as we think of the connecting channel between the pharynx and the
      middle ear, to which his name has been given.

      Fallopius, born in Modena, in 1523, was professor successively at Ferrara,
      Pisa, and Padua. He cultivated anatomy with the greatest ardor, and, in
      consequence, his name is also linked with that of Vesalius, as are those
      of Herophilus and Erasistratus in the history of ancient anatomy. His
      anatomical researches included all parts of the human body, and his name
      has been given to the tube through which the ovum enters the cavity of the
      uterus. Death overtook him in the year 1562.

      Jerome Fabricius, better known as <i>Fabricius ab Aquapendente</i>, was
      born in the town of the latter name, near the southern end of the
      Apennines, in 1537, received his no early<span class="pagenum">110</span><a
      name="link110" id="link110"></a> education in Padua, and studied anatomy
      under Fallopius, whose assistant he also was. After the death of the
      latter he succeeded to the professorship of anatomy, and later built, at
      his own expense, a large anatomical theater, in which he lectured and
      demonstrated to students from all parts of the world. Toward the end of
      his life he had accumulated a large number of specimens, and published
      extensively on anatomy, embryology, physiology, and surgery. Though often
      accredited with discovering the valves of the veins, he is not entitled to
      that honor, since Erasistratus, Sylvius, Vesalius, and others had
      previously described them, Estiennes had seen them in the azygos veins,
      and Canano in other veins. His true claim to glory rests upon
      embryological researches, which he was the first to undertake in a
      comparative way. In <i>De Formato Foetu</i> he elucidated the development
      of the embryo and its membranes by a long list of observations on lower
      animals of many species. He was probably the first to describe the uterine
      decidua. Fabricius died in 1619.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Fabricius must not be confused with the almost-as-renowned Fabricius
      Hildanus, who was born in Hilden, near Düsseldorf, in 1560. Under the
      German name of Wilhelm Fabry he became widely known as a surgeon, and,
      after traveling through France, settled in Hilden, but later moved to
      Cologne, where he founded an academy. His first treatise&mdash;on gangrene
      and sphacelus&mdash;quickly made him known, and went through eleven
      editions. From Cologne he went successively to Genf, Lausanne, and Polen;
      returned to Cologne; and finally, after several other visits, settled in
      Bern, where he died of gout and asthma (in 1634.). His frequent changes of
      location were, perhaps, less the result of instability than a testimony to
      his reputation, inasmuch as he was invited from one place to another. He
      has been, with propriety, named the "German Paré," since he rendered such
      great service to German surgery,<span class="pagenum">111</span><a
      name="link111" id="link111"></a> and was not only an expert therein, but
      likewise a cultivated physician and polished humanitarian; in fact he was
      ahead of his time, by many years, in these regards, as is shown by his
      recommending amputation in cases of gangrene, and his writings concerning
      gunshot wounds. He enjoyed a ripe experience also in obstetrics, and even
      instructed his wife in the obstetric art and praised her ability most
      highly. His most important contributions to literature were in the field
      of surgery, and these passed through numerous editions, while his opinions
      and practice are quoted even to-day.

      During this epoch many modifications were introduced and improvements made
      in the teaching of medicine. Permanent amphitheaters were established for
      dissection, and chairs of anatomy created, their incumbents being paid out
      of the public treasury. The popes, appear to have taken the initiative in
      this respect,<span class="pagenum">112</span><a name="link112" id="link112"></a>
      which accounts for the great number of subjects with which Eustachius was
      supplied, as compared with Vesalius, who obtained only two or three in a
      year. Up to this time <i>the razor had been the sole instrument of
      dissection</i>, but was now replaced by the scalpel, which remains in use
      to-day. By the labors of the few men mentioned anatomy acquired a degree
      of perfection which it had never attained under the Greeks. Skillful
      artists put their labors upon paper, and plates and descriptions made from
      anatomical preparations represented the various parts of the human body
      with more fidelity than had been supposed possible. Nerves, tendons, and
      ligaments were no longer confused, but traced so far as possible from
      origin to ramifications. Ancient errors generally were corrected. It was
      proven that there was no bony structure in the tissue of the heart, that
      the partition between its cavities was not porous; and attentive
      examination of its valves led to the discovery of the lesser circulation
      by Columbus. Michael Servetus, whom John Calvin burned at the stake, was
      perhaps the first to note this phenomenon. He saw that the blood could not
      penetrate directly from the right into the left cavity of the heart, but
      that it was necessary for the whole fluid to pass through the lungs, where
      it became impregnated with the vital spirit of the atmosphere, and reached
      afterward the left auricle; the position of the valves in the pulmonary
      arteries and veins clearly confirmed his conjecture. Moreover the size of
      the pulmonary arteries was enormous, and disproportionate to the quantity
      of blood necessary for the nutrition of the lungs, which seemed to prove
      that this was not, as had been believed, the sole purpose of those
      vessels. It was about this time that Fabricius ab Aquapendente pointed out
      valves in veins in various parts of the body, and that Columbus and
      Andreas Cesalpinus explained more fully the mechanism of the lesser
      circulation; in fact, the former so closely approached an appreciation of
      the<span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a>
      purpose of the vascular system that some have thought he really knew it,
      but the passages in his writings thought to sustain this opinion are not
      at all conclusive. He seems to have confused the action of the heart
      during sleep with that during the waking hours; and although he realized
      that the blood could not flow backward through the arteries, that the vena
      cava was the only vessel which permitted the entrance of blood into the
      heart, and though he spoke of anastomosis between arteries and veins and
      remarked that if a band be applied around a limb the veins swell below the
      ligature, he contented himself with comparing the motion of the blood with
      the flux and reflux of Euripus, as Aristotle had done. It is even thus
      that he tortured his mind in trying to reconcile two irreconcilable
      theories,&mdash;i.e., the opinion of the ancients on the motion of the
      blood and recent discoveries in the anatomy of the vascular system.

      pathology the Arabs had added only a very small number of observations to
      those contained in the works of Galen. The most interesting of these
      pertain to eruptive fevers. Most of their writers contented themselves
      with making an inventory of the acquisitions of the past, as did Guy de
      Chauliac, and this was about all they could do under existing
      circumstances; although they did not make discoveries, they prepared the
      way for their successors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men about this time did a great deal in the direction of creating a
      desire for post-mortem study of cases, and in illustrating and succinctly
      describing symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these was Benivieni, a Florentine, who died in 1502&mdash;the
      date of his birth being uncertain. To him, more than to any other, we owe
      the commencement of the study of gross pathology and pathological anatomy.
      He was the first to consider the knowledge that might be obtained by
      opening bodies for the sole purpose of ascertaining the location and cause
      of the diseases from which they had died. As Malgaigne remarks: "A eulogy
      which he merits, and which he shared with no other person, and which has
      not been accorded to him up to this time by the many historians of surgery
      who have superficially searched among these precious sources, is that he
      was the first who had the habit, felt the need, and set the useful
      example, which he transmitted to his successors, of searching in the
      cadaver, according to the title of his book, for the concealed causes of
      disease." The work referred to by Malgaigne was<span class="pagenum">115</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a> entitled: <i>Concerning Some of the
      Secret and Strange Causes of Disease</i> and was published in Florence in
      1507. It is poor in quotations, but rich in original observations, which
      pertain especially to the etiology of disease, and gives a very concise
      symptomatology and history of each affection of which it treats, as well
      as a pathological explanation. Benivieni's observations on gall-stone, on
      the anatomical lesions of heart diseases, and on the conveyance of
      syphilis from the mother to the foetus were original, as well as many
      observations concerning the presence of worms and other parasites in the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not limit himself to dissection of his own cases, but sought
      autopsies in the cases of others. He examined the bodies of those who had
      been hung, always thinking to find in them something of interest. In this
      regard he was followed by one already mentioned,&mdash;namely, Eustachius.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these two the men who most cultivated pathology and anatomy in the
      sixteenth century were Rembert Dodoens and Marcellus Donatus. The former
      was born in 1517, in Mecheln, traveled extensively, was physician to
      Maximilian II and the Emperor Rudolph, and died in 1585. The latter lived
      and worked in the latter half of the sixteenth century, the dates of his
      birth and death being somewhat uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next man whom we must mention is one who did a great deal for internal
      medicine, pathology, and anatomy. Jean Fernel, who has been surnamed "the
      modern Galen," was born in Clermont in 1497. Even as a boy he showed great
      aptitude, and very early made himself a reputation in philosophy, law, and
      mathematics. In 1530 he was received as doctor, with the unanimous
      applause of the entire faculty of Paris. He seems to have been stimulated
      by this only to more extended study; in fact, so hard did he work at his
      studies that his friends became seriously alarmed for his health, and
      remonstrated with him; they received for reply: "<i>Destiny reserves<span
      class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116" id="link116"></a> for us
      repose enough</i>." He became physician to King Henry II, of France, and
      in the midst of a very extensive practice undertook to collect all the
      medical knowledge scattered in the Greek, Arabic, and Latin works, in
      order to form from it a body of doctrines. His work was written with a
      purity and elegance of Latin that reminds one of Cicero. Throughout its
      pages he was philosophic, and sought to unite the apparently
      irreconcilable doctrines of Plato and Aristotle.<span class="pagenum">117</span><a
      name="link117" id="link117"></a>
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0137.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      He divided medical science into three great sections,&mdash;physiology,
      pathology, and therapeutics. In his explanations of disease he was too
      often fanciful, following the speculations mainly of Galen, and making
      free use of the hypotheses of humors, temperaments, vital spirits, etc.;
      but the following statement of his would do credit to a trained
      pathologist of to-day: "As for myself, I shall never believe I have
      profound knowledge of any affection if I do not know positively, just as
      if I could see it with my eyes, in what part of the human body is the
      disease, its primitive seat, what suspicion of organic lesions constitute
      it, whence it proceeded, if it exists idiopathically or by sympathy, or if
      it be kept up by some exterior cause. He who pretends to be a rational
      physician must sound each of these subjects, and discern them by certain
      signs." The problem which he thus set himself he certainly, for his own
      part, considered as solved, although it was not long before his solutions
      were set aside and the original uncertainty reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      In therapeutics he very early laid down the fundamental maxim that every
      disease must be combated by contrary remedies, justifying this by every
      species of argument, amounting to this: that every disease must be
      combated by its contrary because all that cures a disease is contrary to
      it. This was, in part, the doctrine of "<i>Contraria contrariis curantur</i>"&mdash;the
      antithesis of the equally absurd sophism: "<i>Similia similibus curantur</i>"
      which three hundred years later was erected into an excuse for the
      foundation of an<span class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118"
      id="link118"></a> alleged new school. There can be no doubt that Fernel
      rendered very great service to his time and to subsequent generations,
      despite the fact that his recommendations and statements were too often
      founded upon sophistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just here we must digress for a moment to consider the status of bleeding.
      Hippocrates and Galen had advised to bleed largely from the arm on the
      affected side in pleurisy and pneumonia. That practice was gradually
      abandoned as Greek traditions were lost sight of, and finally the Arabs
      substituted for it something entirely different,&mdash;namely, pricking a
      vein in the foot in order to let blood flow drop by drop. Their method
      prevailed throughout Europe until the commencement of the sixteenth
      century, or about the time when Fernel appeared upon the scene. A Parisian
      physician named Brissot had revived the ancient (the Greek) practice
      during an epidemic of pleurisy, and had obtained thereby astonishing
      success, which he hastened to publish, commending the method employed. He
      thus created a great uproar in the medical world. The innovation found
      foes and defenders, and disputes grew warm, even to the fever point.
      Finally, the ancient method was generally revived, and Fernel accepted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix Plater was born in 1536, in Basel, Switzerland, and died in 1614. He
      had several sons who made their mark in medicine. In his large work, which
      preceded that of Fernel, he took perhaps the first step in an unexplored
      route,&mdash;namely, in the classification of disease <i>according to the
      totality of apparent symptoms</i>. Defective as this classification
      appears in our eyes, its author lived a long life as a very distinguished
      practitioner and professor in his native town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giovanni Batista Porta was born in Naples in 1536, traveled extensively in
      Italy, France, and Spain, and founded in 1560 an Academy of the Segreti.
      He was accused of magic, and was compelled to refute the charges in Rome.<span
      class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119" id="link119"></a> He died in
      1615, having been one of the leading scientists of his time, and the
      founder of modern optics. In the first edition of his <i>Magia Naturalis</i>,
      published in Naples, 1587, is found the first description of the camera
      obscura,&mdash;of course, in a very incomplete form and without lenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Severino was a celebrated surgeon of Naples. He was born in 1580, in
      Calabria, studied in Naples, became a doctor in Salernum, and then became
      professor of anatomy in his native town. For a long time the victim of
      intrigue and of persecution by the Inquisition, he was finally driven out
      of Naples, but was called back by the populace. He then became the most
      celebrated teacher of his time, writing extensively on a variety of
      subjects. He died in 1656 of the plague, an epidemic of which was at that
      time raging in central Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving now at the surgery of this Age, we find that matters were more
      chaotic than in other departments of medicine, and for reasons which are
      easily given and appreciated. While, ordinarily, external diseases are
      more easily discerned than internal, and while in a corresponding degree
      they can be more satisfactorily treated; while, in other words, external
      pathology has ordinarily taken precedence of internal in professional as
      in lay minds, this view seems to have been inverted for a time during the
      Middle Ages. Previous to the period now under discussion the sciences had
      generally declined in Europe, and surgery had fallen even lower than
      medicine, for the reason that medicine was in the hands of the priests,
      who had at that time something of a liberal education, while the practice
      of surgery was abandoned to a class of ignorant barbers, bathers, and
      bone-setters. No mechanic or artisan could take as an apprentice any youth
      without a certificate affirming his legitimate birth, and that he came
      from a family in which there were neither barbers, bath-keepers,
      shepherds, nor butchers. Among the men who were thus made social outcasts<span
      class="pagenum">120</span><a name="link120" id="link120"></a> were those
      into whose hands most of the surgery of the fifteenth century fell. This
      was particularly the case in Germany, and other European countries were
      little in advance. We have seen that in France and in Italy Lanfranc and
      Guy de Chauliac did their best to rescue surgery from the hands of these
      men, but their efforts did not prevent it from being completely abandoned
      by the clergy, who devoted themselves to the practice of medicine.<span

    <p>
      When we come to inquire the reason for this&mdash;in other words, why an
      art so useful as surgery, and one which made such requirements for
      knowledge, sagacity, and dexterity, whose necessity was almost continually
      felt, particularly during these troublous times of almost constant
      warfare, should be so neglected by men who could best comprehend its
      utility and respond to its requirements&mdash;it is difficult to find a
      satisfactory answer. The social condition of the times sheds some light
      upon the question. The nations of southern Europe were socially divided at
      that time into the nobility, who were nearly always at war; the clergy,
      who monopolized learning and filled the so-called liberal professions;
      and, finally, the common people, who were common prey for both the other
      classes, and who yet had to support both without having any privileges of
      their own. While the practice of medicine was a clerical right, the canon
      of the church prohibited physicians from drawing blood, under pain of
      excommunication; and hence surgery, shunned by the priests, to whom it
      naturally belonged in connection with the practice of medicine, fell into
      the hands of the ignorant and vulgar, who practiced it in a purely
      mechanical way, without knowledge or appreciation of its possibilities. In
      addition to this, there was an almost total lack of detailed and precise
      anatomical knowledge, and but small reason to expect that the ignorant
      practitioners of surgery would feel the need of such knowledge. Moreover,
      most of the operators were itinerants, going from city to city, stopping
      so long as they had cases to operate upon or until<span class="pagenum">122</span><a
      name="link122" id="link122"></a> some reverse forced them to depart. Most
      of these men limited themselves to one or two sorts of operations. Some
      operated for cataract, others for stone, others for hernia, nearly every
      one having a secret method which was transmitted to his posterity as a
      heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the history of medicine certain family names of itinerant operators
      have been preserved; for example, the Branca, the Norsini, in Italy, and
      the Colot in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under such conditions there could be no such thing as the profession of
      the surgeon. The prejudice against dissection did not begin to abate until
      the thirteenth century, when a very few of the clergy dared, in a very
      timid manner, to perform surgical operations. Their numbers increased in
      the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and in the sixteenth
      had become considerable. Most of the great anatomists of that period&mdash;such
      as Benivieni, de Carpi, Vesalius, Fallopius, and Fabricius ab Aquapendente&mdash;were
      great surgeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time it came about that while the clerical physicians were willing
      to descend to the rank of operators, the lay-surgeons aspired to the rank
      of doctors of medicine. This transformation took place especially in
      France, the only country where at that time there was a special college of
      surgeons&mdash;the small Brotherhood of St. Come, already alluded to,
      which was always contending against the faculty on one hand and against
      the barber-surgeons on the other, with varying results, and which, at
      last, sought peace with the university and was received by it. This took
      place in 1515, and was the renaissance of surgery, not only for Paris, but
      for the whole world. By this reunion the faculty acquired authority over
      the barbers, who were admitted to their lectures and took courses in
      anatomy and surgery, gradually attaining a knowledge which entitled them
      to be called barber-surgeons; their rights were not curtailed, but made
      more difficult of procurement, for, in addition to passing their
      initiation for the privilege of becoming barbersurgeons,<span
      class="pagenum">123</span><a name="link123" id="link123"></a> they also
      had to pass an examination before the physicians and the two surgeons of
      the king, at Chatelet, for the right to practice surgery. The surgeons, as
      the price of their submission to the faculty, had, beside the university
      privilege, a sort of supremacy over the barbers; and thus it happened that
      the barbers were admitted to the rank of surgeons at St. Come, and that
      the surgeons of St. Come were admitted as barber-surgeons by the faculty
      of medicine. In this double capacity they approached nearer the profession
      of medicine, from which they should never have been separated, while
      surgery became an art which received numerous improvements. We must now
      devote a little time to the consideration of at least two or three of the
      men who most contributed to extend and elevate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who most contributed to make the period of which we are now
      speaking a glorious one, raising himself from the lowest walks of life to
      the attainment of the highest professional honors, is Ambroise Paré, whose
      name will never die while the art of surgery is taught. Paré was born
      about the year 1510, at Laval, of poor parents. He was an early apprentice
      to the provincial barber-surgeons, after which a natural ambition for
      improvement led him to Paris (about the year 1532), where he studied three
      years at the Hôtel-Dieu, and obtained the confidence of his teachers to
      such an extent that he sometimes operated for them. He never learned
      Latin, the language at that time of the books and of the schools. Paré was
      most fond of recalling his hospital experience; he counted it among the
      highest honors of his life that he should have enjoyed what he there did
      enjoy, and gives us to suppose that he was a favorite upon whom peculiar
      favors were conferred. In one of his writings, a physician of Milan having
      expressed astonishment at so young a man's knowledge, he remarks with
      pride: "But the good man did not know that I had been house-surgeon for
      three years at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris." The functions of the barber
      apprentices in the hospital<span class="pagenum">124</span><a
      name="link124" id="link124"></a> in those days were probably to make
      dressings and bleedings, and sometimes post-mortem examinations ordered by
      the chiefs, to assist the latter in their operations, and to act in case
      of emergency; in other words, to do about as the <i>internes</i> at
      present do. They probably found there a precious and rare opportunity for
      anatomical dissection, but it does not appear that they had regular
      clinical instruction.

      In 1537 Paré was made surgeon to the Colonel-General of Infantry, René de
      Montijean, with whom he made his first campaign in Italy. (This was in the
      army which King Francis I assembled in Provence with which to repulse the
      invasion of Charles V.) He had never seen war nor recent gunshot wounds,
      and only knew of them by what he had read in the writings of John de Vigo.
      This was at<span class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125" id="link125"></a>
      a time when it was the custom of surgeons to pour boiling oil into every
      amputation or other wound in order to check haemorrhage; and Paré's
      experience in this, his first campaign, put him in the way of his first
      discovery,&mdash;a discovery which will never be forgotten. He has
      recounted in his <i>Book of Arquebus Wounds</i> and in his great <i>Apology</i>
      how after the affair of Pas-de-Suze he watched the other surgeons,
      dreaming of nothing else but to imitate them as far as he could; how the
      boiling oil gave out; how his anxiety about it prevented him from
      sleeping; and how to his great wonder he found that the wounded who had
      submitted to the operation suffered more than the others. This set him to
      thinking, and led him, a young man without name or authority, without
      letters or philosophical studies, to observe, to reason, and to combat a
      doctrine which was universally admitted and which the highest surgical
      authorities of the day sustained. At that time all authors who had spoken
      of gunshot wounds considered them as poisonous and complicated with burns;
      consequently they gave the precept to cauterize with boiling oil or a
      red-hot iron, and at the same time to administer certain alexipharmics
      which should serve as internal antidotes. John de Vigo, physician to Pope
      Julius II, assures us that the danger of these wounds results from the
      round formation of the balls, from heat, and from the poisonous qualities
      communicated to them by the powder. His theory and the method of treatment
      above given had been adopted without contradiction until the day when Paré
      dared to utter the first protest against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a campaign of three years, in which he lost his master, he returned
      to Paris and married. In 1543 he was in the army of Perpignan, in the
      service of de Rohan, grand lord of Brittany, where he gave continuous
      proof of his sagacity. It was after this campaign that his reputation, so
      well established among warriors and the nobility, inspired Sylvius with
      the desire of seeing him. Paré has recounted<span class="pagenum">126</span><a
      name="link126" id="link126"></a> how, in a conversation which they had
      together, he insisted upon the then entirely new precept, of which he had
      made many applications, that in order to extract bullets it was best to
      place the wounded in the position in which they were at the moment of
      injury.

      Sylvius,<span class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127" id="link127"></a>
      then at the height of his fame, invited the young physician to dinner, and
      listened to him with great attention while he explained his views on
      gunshot wounds, which made such an impression upon the mind of the host
      that he besought him eagerly to write them out and make them public.
      Encouraged by this advice from so high a source, Paré prepared his text,
      illustrated it, and in the year 1545 brought out his little work, which
      marked in a manner so glorious the revival of French surgery. It was
      published by Gaulterot, the sworn bookseller of the University of Paris,
      and was entitled "<i>The Manner of Treating Wounds made by Arquebuses and
      other Fire-arms, and those made by Arrows, Darts, and the Like; and also
      by Burns made Especially by Gunpowder</i>. Composed by Ambroise Paré,
      Master Barber-Surgeon in Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later appeared the second edition, in which he still
      recommended the actual cautery in haemorrhage; but each day he meditated
      upon the subject, and on one occasion discussed it with two surgeons of
      St. Come, submitting to them the idea that, since ligatures were applied
      to veins and arteries, and to recent wounds, there was nothing to prevent
      their being equally applied to amputations. Both agreed with him, and
      opportunity soon presented itself at the siege of Damvilliers, when a
      gentleman had his leg crushed by a shot from the fortress. Paré made an
      amputation, omitting for the first time the use of the cautery, and had
      the happiness to save his patient, who, full of joy at having escaped the
      red-hot iron, said he had got clear of his leg on very good terms. This
      was, in truth, the actual renaissance of surgery, which had been to that
      time a torture, but which became thereafter a blessed art. It was a
      barber-surgeon who produced the double marvel. This took place in 1552.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1554, after other campaigns, Paré was made, without examination, Master
      of the College of St. Come, and in 1559 was included among the surgeons of
      King Henry II (who<span class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128"
      id="link128"></a> was killed in a tourney, in Paris, in 1559)r which
      position he retained with Francis II and Charles IX. The latter raised him
      to the highest position among his surgeons, and King Henry III retained
      him, which caused the witty and true remark that the kings of France
      transferred him to their successors as a legacy of the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many anecdotes are related of Paré to show the remarkable esteem in which
      he was held by public and private citizens. For instance, in October,
      1552, one of the most eminent generals of Charles V laid seige to the city
      of Metz, and the emperor came in person to join the army. Within the walls
      of this beleaguered city were gathered nearly all the nobility and princes
      of France. The city was defended by the Duke of Guise, and the besieged
      soldiers were at that time suffering alike from the attacks of the enemy,
      the results of the siege, and the rigors of a frightful winter. The duke
      had established two hospitals for the soldiers, and had put into
      requisition the barber-surgeons of the city, giving them money with which
      to furnish their supplies. But these surgeons were sadly incompetent
      against the combination of unfavorable circumstances, consequently nearly
      all the wounded perished, and a horrible suspicion was roused among the
      soldiers that they had been poisoned. Under these circumstances the duke
      dispatched one of his captains to the king to say that the place could
      hold out for ten months, and asked at the same time for fresh medicine.
      The king sent for Paré, gave him money, directed him to take all the
      medicine he thought necessary, and furnished him a letter to Marshal St.
      Andre, who commanded in Verdun, and who bribed an Italian captain for
      fifteen hundred crowns to introduce into the besieged city the celebrated
      surgeon. The expedition was perilous, and Paré himself would have
      willingly remained in Paris. But he entered Metz on the 8th of December,
      at midnight, without an accident. Having passed already sixteen years in
      war, he was<span class="pagenum">129</span><a name="link129" id="link129"></a>
      known to the chiefs and common soldiers. The day after his arrival, the
      duke, who knew how to strike the imagination, presented him on the
      ramparts to all the princes, lords, and captains, who embraced and
      received him with clamor. By the soldiers he was received with shouts of
      triumph. "We shall not die," they exclaimed; "even though wounded; Paré is
      among us!" From this time the defense was conducted with renewed vigor,
      and it has been universally conceded that to the presence of this single
      man the city was indebted for its salvation. <span class="pagenum">131</span><a name="link131" id="link131"></a>The siege itself was not
      raised until after a terrific conflict. On the very day of Paré's arrival
      he began to treat the leg of one of the prominent officers, who for four
      days had been in charge of a charlatan, and had suffered horrible
      tortures. The next day he decided to trephine another, who had been struck
      on the head by a fragment of stone, and who had been insensible for
      fourteen days. Both patients recovered. <span class="pagenum">132</span><a name="link132" id="link132"></a>

      have within their ranks the man who enjoyed such great renown. They,
      therefore, admitted him to an examination, in spite of the statute which
      required that the candidate should understand Latin, and in spite of
      opposition by the professors of the university. They not only admitted him

      Paré in his time met with a success which to-day would be pronounced
      extraordinary. He seemed to inspire the wounded with the utmost
      confidence, and to possess greatness and firmness of character in the
      highest degree. It is perhaps, even more extraordinary that with so strong
      a character he should have so long retained favor at court. In the midst
      of the excitement of camps, and a very extended practice, he found time to
      read all that had been published on his art, and to compose himself a
      great number of works, enriching all branches of surgery. Instead of
      keeping secret his inventions, as was the custom of the time, he made them
      as public as possible, saying, in the preface of his large work on
      surgery: "For my part, I have dispensed liberally to everybody the gifts
      that God has conferred upon me, and I am none the worse for it; just as
      the light of a candle will not diminish no matter how many may come to
      light their torches by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides his smaller treatises, his large, collective works passed through
      a number of editions, and were everywhere reprinted and studied. Not only
      was he great in surgery, but he attained a high degree of expertness in
      midwifery. Among other things, he restored the forgotten practice of
      podalic version in cases where this procedure is necessary. He died in
      1590.<span class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134" id="link134"></a>

      The doctrine of Paré on gunshot wounds was rapidly disseminated. From
      1550, Maggi, of Bologna, advocated it without giving credit to its real
      author, and sustained it by decisive experiments. He observed that none of
      the wounded felt any heat, and that the torn portions of their clothing
      showed no trace of fire; and he shot balls through packages of powder
      without setting them on fire. At the same time Lange spread this view in
      Germany, and Botal, of Turin,<span class="pagenum">135</span><a

      While Ambroise Paré did not disdain to act as accoucheur, it was his
      friend and pupil, Jacob Guillemeau (1550-1613), who, in the sixteenth
      century, most occupied himself with the practice of obstetrics. We owe to
      Guillemeau the first improvements that the moderns made in this art; for
      instance, the proposition to rapidly and artificially terminate
      parturition in cases of considerable haemorrhage or when the woman is
      taken with convulsions during labor. Guillemeau supported this practice on
      the authority of Hippocrates, and operated on a great number of patients,
      proving its value and the danger of its neglect.

      The Cæsarean operation was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, but had
      been abandoned during the Middle Ages. It' remained for the accoucheurs
      and surgeons of the sixteenth century to re-establish it. Among others,
      Rousset, physician to the Duke of Savoy, who recommended it very warmly,
      reported several cases where it had a happy issue for both mother and
      child. He even reported the most remarkable case of all,&mdash;that of a
      woman who was six times delivered by this operation, and who perished in
      the seventh confinement, because, as he states, the surgeon who had been
      accustomed to operate on her was absent. Unfortunately, this case is not
      authenticated. <span class="pagenum">136</span><a name="link136"

      Nothing shows better how the art of observation and accurate description
      of phenomena had progressed at the time of the revival of letters than the
      number of new diseases of which the authors of that period make mention.
      Then, for the first time did one read of whooping-cough, miliaria, scurvy,
      plica polonica, syphilis, and raphania. It is scarcely credible that these
      diseases fell upon Europe at this particular time. It is more probable
      that they had a more ancient existence and were not recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to-day medical men are divided in their own opinions on the origin of
      syphilis, some believing that it was developed spontaneously in Europe
      toward the close of the sixteenth century, others that it was imported
      from the New World, others that it had a most ancient origin, and others
      yet that it represented a degenerated form of leprosy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain it is that syphilis appeared almost simultaneously in all parts of
      Europe,&mdash;at Bologna, Halle, Brunswick, in Lombardy, Apulia, Auvergne,
      and so on. Léonicenus attributed this sudden outbreak to an extraordinary
      inundation that occurred in all parts of Italy toward the close of the
      fourteenth century, and supported his views with the authority of
      Hippocrates and Galen. Others attributed it to astrological influence;
      while still others regarded it as a scourge of God with which to punish
      men and turn them away from unbridled libertinism, Fallopius thought
      venereal disease was engendered by the poison which the perfidious
      Neapolitans had thrown into the wells from which the French drew their
      water. These wild views simply indicate the spirit of the age. Oviedo
      published in 1545 a history of the West Indies, in which he states that
      syphilis originated in America. He held that when Columbus returned from
      his second expedition to the New World, in 1496, his men enlisted under
      Gonsalvo de Cordova to go and fight the French, who had invaded the
      Kingdom of Naples, and that they communicated to the French and
      Neapolitans the disease which they had brought from San Domingo. Unhappily
      for his veracity, it is certain that syphilis broke out in Naples at least
      two years before the arrival of the Spanish fleet. It is equally certain
      that at none of the points at which Columbus touched on his return from
      his first expedition was there any manifestation of syphilis for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the venereal disease, so-called, included those conditions
      which we now differentiate under the names of syphilis, chancroid, and
      gonorrhoea,&mdash;a confusion of diseases<span class="pagenum">138</span><a
      name="link138" id="link138"></a> which persisted even up to the time of
      John Hunter. It is worth while to publish this fact, since writers of two
      or three hundred years ago may not have meant by the term "syphilis" just
      what we would mean to-day. Without going into this question here, it is
      enough to say that one who reads intelligently may see in the Sacred
      Scriptures unmistakable allusions to this disease. If the statements of
      David, as contained in the Psalms, are reliable, he was himself a serious
      sufferer from it. The ancient Greek and Arabian physicians make mention of
      lesions which could only be attributed to this disease; and the Latin
      satirists, like Horace and Juvenal, describe symptoms of a certain kind as
      being the fruit only of shameful practices.<span class="pagenum">137</span><a

      It is most likely that the sudden appearance of syphilis in nearly all
      parts of Europe at about the same time, which has been regarded as so
      extraordinary, can be explained by the clearer distinctions physicians
      began to make between symptoms of this disease and those of leprosy.
      Arrangements for the cure of lepers were very complete, and such
      syphilitic patients as responded kindly to the treatment thereby
      established themselves in a very different category of disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first writer to systematically consider venereal disease was Astruc,
      who was born in Languedoc in 1684 and died in 1766. He was the principal
      advocate of the view that syphilis had an American origin, in which view
      he was bitterly opposed by Sanchez, a Portuguese physician, who collected
      a large amount of evidence to the effect that its first ravages were
      observed in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summing up this whole matter, we may agree with Jourdan, who has examined
      all the opinions of these writers, and who, in his treatise published in
      1826, concluded that all symptoms which had been hitherto connected with
      syphilis had been known and described from the remotest antiquity, but
      were not supposed to proceed<span class="pagenum">139</span><a
      name="link139" id="link139"></a> from a common source, and to be attached
      to the same cause, until after the close of the fifteenth century.

    <h3>
      THE INFLUENCE OF THE OCCULT SCIENCES ON THE MEDICINE OF THIS PERIOD.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Most of the partisans of occult science were restless minds, such as are
      found in all ages, who chafed under the yoke of authority, and who
      practiced as well as deduced their lines of thought and conduct in
      accordance with their own ideas. Some of these men did not lack in
      sagacity, imagination, or audacity, but almost all of them lacked in
      consistency of idea and dignity of thought. Most of them lived isolated
      lives, apart from each other and from the rest of the world, and were, to
      a large extent, what we would now regard as "cranks." While they made a
      wide departure from accredited doctrine, they depended upon imagination
      rather than upon reason. This happened to be a period, however, when such
      men achieved great notoriety,&mdash;more so than the same class of
      individuals have done since their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius Agrippa (born in 1486) was an early promoter of occult science.
      He came of a noble family of Cologne, received the best éducation of his
      time, was a man of varied attainments, great inconsistency in conduct, and
      a caustic humor which everywhere made him enemies and prevented him from
      having any settled abode. He wandered from place to place, sometimes
      honored with the favor of the nobility and sometimes plunged into extreme
      misery. He early became a secretary in the court of Emperor Maximilian I,
      and under that monarch distinguished himself in the army by such bravery
      as to win him spurs as a knight. Soon disgusted with the profession of
      arms, he devoted himself to law and medicine, but his intemperate pen soon
      drew him into quarrels and persecution. At Dole he fell out with the
      monks; at Paris<span class="pagenum">140</span><a name="link140"
      id="link140"></a> and Turin he compromised himself with the theologians;
      at Metz he incurred the animosity of the Jacobins for attacking the
      prevailing opinion that St. Ann had three husbands. He became a vagabond
      and almost a beggar in Germany, England, and Switzerland, and then went to
      Lyons, where the mother of Francis I, who was then Queen Regent, made him
      her physician. He soon lost favor here, and was disgraced and banished;
      then he went to the Low Countries, where he was imprisoned on account of
      his treatise on <i>The Vanity of the Sciences.</i> Afterward he returned
      to Lyons, was imprisoned anew, for an old libel against his former patron,
      and finally died in the hospital of Grenoble, in 1535, at the age of about
      fifty. His treatise on <i>The Vanity of the Sciences</i> made him most
      trouble, and showed best both his bitterness of spirit and the extent of
      his learning. Herein he laid down the paradox, which was later renewed and
      sustained by Rousseau, that there is nothing more pernicious and injurious
      to common life, or more pestilential to the salvation of souls, than the
      arts and sciences. He founded this thesis on Scriptural authority, and
      supported it by profane testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusions which Agrippa drew were not so strange to the eyes of his
      contemporaries as they are to ours. Long before him, men of character and
      attainments, such as Pic de la Mirandola and Bessarion, had attempted to
      introduce the Platonic idea, that the best means of acquiring science and
      truth were introspective. They were, moreover, persuaded that a great
      number of phenomena and events have their origin in astral influences.
      From this system to the extravagance of the Cabal * is but<span
      class="pagenum">141</span><a name="link141" id="link141"></a> a step;
      indeed, the Christian doctrine, that events and phenomena are influenced
      by the direct intervention of the deity or of the devil, is but a small
      transposition. The cabalistic theory, summed up, was that all the events
      of life and all the phenomena of nature proceed from influences which
      gods, devils, or the stars exercised on the "archetype"'&mdash;that is, on
      the essential spirit, or substance. He who could withdraw his spirit
      possessed supernatural faculties. The day and the hour of birth, according
      to this view, were under the domination of particular stars and each of
      the principal members of the body was supposed to correspond with some
      planet or constellation. This is the fundamental idea underlying the
      pictures&mdash;which are still to be found on almanacs used by
      quack-medicine firms&mdash;of the individual whose interior is so
      completely and uncomfortably exposed, while around him are arranged the
      signs of the zodiac, with indications as to which part of the body is
      governed by each.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Cabal, or Kabbalah: A theosophieal or mystic speculative
     system, of Hebrew origin, which flourished from the tenth to
     the sixteenth century. It included a mystic theosophy and
     cosmogony, attributing to deity neither will, desire, nor
     action, but teaching that from it emanated wisdom, grace,
     intellect, power, beauty, firmness, and other attributes. It
     also ascribed hidden meanings to the sacred Hebrew writings
     and words. Even in the letters and forms of the sacred words
     the followers of the cabal pretended to find wonderful and
     hidden meanings; hence the modern expression "cabalistic."
     The teachings of the cabal were esoteric, of course, and
     inculcated mysticism and occultism in everything, but
     appear to have been more or less influenced by neoplatonism.
</pre>
    <p>
      Occult philosophy, built upon this foundation, was divided into four
      branches: <i>theosophy,</i> to which a man raised himself by prayer; <i>magic</i>,
      or the art of controlling demons; <i>astrology</i>, or the art of reading
      future events by the stars; and <i>alchemy</i>, which teaches the secret
      of extracting the essence or the archetype of substances,&mdash;i.e.,
      virtually the secret of the philosopher's stone, by which metals were to
      be transmuted and then abolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the errors of science, the prejudices of the superstitious, the
      excitement of the religious, and the cupidity of the rich and powerful,
      all concurred to propagate the faults of the cabal at the close of the
      Middle Ages. Never were there seen so many sorcerers, astrol-ogists, and
      alchemists; never were prophecies, visions, and prodigies so common.
      Whatever happened, it was pretended<span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142" id="link142"></a> that it had been announced by some
      previous sign, or that it was a revelation of the future. This particular
      kind of folly persisted in Germany longer than in any other part of the
      world. Even Martin Luther seemed to share many of the cabalistic views,
      and his alleged struggle with the devil, his adventure with the inkstand,
      and so on, contributed much to spread them, and were, perhaps, the most
      prominent illustrations of their general acceptance. Surely, these were
      the Dark Ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome Cardan was born at Pavia in 1501. His life, like that of Agrippa,
      was one of vicissitude and inconsistency. Being the idol of his mother and
      the detestation of his father produced a peculiar effect upon his
      character. When he began to study he made rapid progress, and at the age
      of twenty-two was able to discuss publicly all questions. About two years
      later he received his doctor's hat. He practiced medicine in various
      places until he was thirty-three, and was then made professor of
      mathematics at Milan. He occupied this position but two years, then
      traveled in Germany, France, and England, and returning to Italy was
      imprisoned for debt in Bologna, and finally obtained a pension from the
      pope, in Rome, where he died in 1556. He was a man of great attainments
      and sagacity; his literary style was dignified, and, if he had not
      developed such a taste for the marvelous, such inconceivable credulity and
      superstition, and such vanity and boasting, he would have been a
      remarkable character in his age. Leibnitz said of him: "Notwithstanding
      his faults, Cardan was a great man and, without his defects, would have
      been incomparable." He wrote extensively on philosophy, mathematics, and
      medicine. Sometimes he admitted to his writings the most absurd statements
      of visions, etc., and again affirmed that he had never devoted himself to
      cabalistic art, blamed those who practiced it, and jeered at those who
      believed in it. He wrote extensively on chiromancy. For his own follies
      and misfortunes he apologized,<span class="pagenum">143</span><a
      name="link143" id="link143"></a> attributing them all to the influences of
      the stars.

    <p>
      The most colossal figure in this collection of mediaeval charlatans and
      knaves was Paracelsus. He was born in 1493, near Zurich, of a well-to-do
      family, his father being a physician. He had a good preliminary education,
      and then visited the various universities, or rather university towns;
      but, instead of listening to the professors, Paracelsus associated with
      clever women, barbers, magicians, alchemists, and the like, from whom he
      acquired much information. He was led at once to the vagaries of the
      cabal, and, according to his own statement, he did not open a book for ten
      years. He neglected his studies and forgot his Latin, so that he became
      incapable of expressing himself in<span class="pagenum">144</span><a
      name="link144" id="link144"></a> that language. From the age of
      twenty-five he became a hard drinker, and this habit ultimately worked his
      ruin. One of his disciples says of him that during the two years which he
      passed with him he was so inclined to drinking and debauchery that he
      could scarcely be seen for an hour or two without being full of wine,
      although that condition did not prevent him from being admired by every
      one as a second Æsculapius.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Paracelsus was between thirty-three and thirty-five years of
      age, and at, apparently, the most brilliant period of his life. He had
      written extensively and with emphasis of his numerous cures, after the
      fashion of charlatans of those days,&mdash;and, unfortunately, of to-day,&mdash;and
      claimed to be possessed of infallible secrets against the most intractable
      diseases. He had just been called to Basel to the chair of physic and
      surgery, and crowds of curious and idle persons attended his lectures,
      which he gave in the vernacular, and not, as was customary in those days,
      in Latin. In order to strike his auditors with astonishment, he began by
      burning the works of Galen and Avicenna, and then reading from his own
      writings, breaking off from time to time into the statement: "Know, ye
      doctors, that my hat knows more than you; that my beard is more
      experienced than your academies. Greeks, Latins, Arabians, French,
      Italians, Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, you must follow me; I shall
      not follow you, for I am your monarch, and sovereignty belongs to me." As
      may be imagined, his professorship was not one of long duration, and he
      soon had few or no listeners. In consequence of some mishaps he left Basel
      quite precipitately, his departure causing no such sensation as his
      arrival. He then resumed his nomadic life, and we find him at Alsace in
      1528, at Nuremberg in 1529, at St. Galle in 1531, at Mindelheim in 1540,
      and in the following year at Salzburg, where he died in the hospital at
      the age of forty-eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few men there are of whom so much good and so much<span class="pagenum">145</span><a
      name="link145" id="link145"></a> evil has been written as of Paracelsus.
      Few are there of whom it is to-day so hard to judge, since, if we refer to
      his contemporaries, they disagree completely concerning him, and if we
      refer to his own writings we fall into still greater chaos and have to
      abandon the attempt. His writings show ideas without connection,
      observations which contradict each other, and phrases which defy
      comprehension. At one moment he gives proof of admirable penetration, at
      the next simply abject nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he exerted an influence upon his time is certain, but that this
      influence was retrograde rather than progressive seems quite likely. His
      exact duplicate has probably never existed since his time, and we may say
      that never was there another man like Aurelius Phillip-pus Theophrastus
      Paracelsus Bombastus ab Hohenheim&mdash;his full name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this man was such a prominent character in his day, his name must
      be erased from the list of those who have contributed to the world's
      progress. He was simply a pretended reformer, who counted as nothing the
      most erudite writings, and who relied solely on his own experience. He had
      the most profound self-confidence, and played upon the credulity of his
      neighbors and victims with the toys which were furnished him by the
      prevalent cabalistic notions of the day. The school which he would have
      founded was nothing but a school of ignorance, dissipation, and boasting&mdash;a
      school of medical dishonesty. In a word, it was, as Renouard has said, "a
      school of which Thessalus, of Tralles, had been the Corypheus in
      antiquity, which John of Gaddesden revived in the Middle Ages, and to
      which Paracelsus gave a new development."
    </p>
    <p>
      While, as has been briefly recounted, the partisans of the occult sciences
      strove to completely overturn the scientific edifice of antiquity, other
      reformers, more sensible and<span class="pagenum">146</span><a
      name="link146" id="link146"></a> less daring, were content to expose its
      defects without attacking it in its entirety. These were, for the most
      part, enlightened men, and at the same time free thinkers,&mdash;friends
      of progress, and not of destruction. During the sixteenth century these
      men were few in number, but at least three or four of them deserve
      mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Argentier was born in Piedmont, and taught in Naples, Pisa, and
      Turin. He did not hesitate to take issue with the theories and statements
      of Galen, and criticised those who adopted them too servilely. Of him it
      may be said that, although styled a reformer, nevertheless, he kept too
      near to the doctrines of those against whom he inveighed to seriously
      weaken their position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard Botal, also a Piedmontese, was born in 1530. First a surgeon in
      the French army, he later became physician to the kings Charles IX and
      Henri III. He was the first to recommend frequent and general
      bloodletting. Apparently before his time this practice was greatly
      restrained. He carried his views so far as to maintain that an infirm old
      man should be bled from two to six times a year, and that it was good
      custom to open the veins of healthy individuals every six months. He wrote
      a remarkable memoir on the cure of disease by blood-letting. It is not to
      be denied that he obtained some remarkable success with his copious
      venesections, and it must be said, in his defense, that, if he overdid it,
      his contemporaries did not resort to it often enough, and that his own
      practices were instructive to others. In his writings he united
      independence and energy of thought with elegance and purity of style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joubert (1529-1583) was Chancellor in the University of Montpellier and
      physician to King Henri III. He wrote a treatise on <i>Popular Errors</i>,
      which had an unheard-of success. In less than six months there were sold
      nearly five thousand copies, which, considering the times,<span
      class="pagenum">147</span><a name="link147" id="link147"></a> constituted
      a prodigious edition. For one thing, it was written in the common tongue,
      and so placed within the reach of all. It was also diversified with
      anecdotes and jokes, some of which were not of the most delicate
      character; in fact, the author endeavored to atone for some of its
      salacity by dedicating it to Queen Marguerite. He really proposed for his
      main purpose a serious and useful one,&mdash;namely, that of combating
      prejudices which were both injurious and ridiculous. Although we may make
      light of Joubert's treatise, it certainly achieved a useful end by
      dissipating a multitude of errors, giving information to those who could
      scarcely get it as well from any other source. That it was full of defects
      is simply another form of saying that it was published in the middle of
      the sixteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during this period of which we have written that the separation of
      the priesthood from medicine was completed. From the sixteenth century
      celibacy was not obligatory on physicians in the Kingdom of France, and
      they no longer enjoyed ecclesiastical benefices. At this time, too,
      surgery, which had naturally been separated from medicine, began to
      approach it, the combination thus gradually brought about inuring to the
      benefit of all concerned. From now on, the professors of St. Come were on
      the same level as the professors of the university, and enjoyed equal
      privileges. Institutions for instruction in medicine increased, and those
      which already existed were developed. Amphitheaters for dissection were
      open in every city in Europe. Hospitals and dispensaries were established
      alongside the schools, and by the various governments more attention was
      paid to the protection of the public from imposition, and to the
      amelioration of every evil affecting either public or private health.

      the Italian universities held the first rank; next came the French; and
      last the German, although all were well attended. The most famous were the
      medical faculties of Bologna, Pisa, Padua; then Paris, Montpellier, and,
      finally, Basel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little of what concerned the student-life of this period may not be
      amiss. The students chose the rector and officers of the universities,
      sometimes even the teachers, and assisted in determining the curriculum of
      study, the execution of which they watched. In some of the Scotch
      universities even now the students choose the rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students were divided, usually according to country, into bodies
      denominated "nations" (some having special seals), which were the parents
      of the present stu-dent-corps in German universities. Certain
      representatives, known as vice-rectors, were chosen from each of these
      corps and constituted a so-called college of rectors which negotiated with
      the officials of the State, and possessed a power that was preserved until
      the end of the sixteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poorer class of students passed from one school to another, supporting
      themselves by singing, begging, or stealing, and were sometimes guilty of
      great barbarities. The younger scholars, called "Schutzen," were compelled
      to perform<span class="pagenum">149</span><a name="link149" id="link149"></a>
      most menial duties for their older comrades, the "Bacchanten,"&mdash;much
      like the system of fagging still in vogue in English grammar-schools; and
      when the bacchantes were admitted to the university proper they were
      required to pass through an initiation, or hazing, which eclipsed anything
      known in these days; indeed, the antiquity of fagging may be traced back
      even to the philosophic schools of Athens. The habits of the traveling
      scholars led many of them into dissolute and vicious ways, though some
      attained respectable positions,&mdash;possibly even eminence. The students
      who were better situated financially; for the most part entered the
      Italian universities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already mention has been made of the enormous number of students
      congregated during this age in Bologna and in Naples. In the small
      University of Wettenburg there were, in 1520, only about six hundred
      students; in Erfurt, three hundred, and this number dwindled two years
      later to fifteen; in 1500 Leipzig had four hundred students; at the same
      time there were about seven thousand in the University of Vienna. Students
      and teachers migrated from one place to another, and faculties were
      constantly changing. Great teachers were received with great ceremony.
      Bitter struggles and disputes between teachers sometimes occurred; it is
      related of Pistorius, who died in 1523, and Pollich, deceased in 1513,
      that they conceived a violent enmity toward each other because of
      antagonistic views relative to the epidemic or contagious character of
      syphilis, and both ultimately left Leipzig for other schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some curious customs prevailed. In teaching anatomy, while the learned
      teachers explained the parts as exposed, the dissections were left to
      barbers as being unworthy of an educated medical gentleman. While the
      cadavers were mainly the corpses of executed criminals, it was thought
      that before and after each special dissection religious ceremonies were
      appropriate, and such were often held; it was also believed that all who
      came in contact with such a corpse<span class="pagenum">150</span><a
      name="link150" id="link150"></a> would be made disreputable unless it were
      itself first made reputable; hence the professors first read aloud a
      decree to that effect from the magistrate, and then, by order of the
      senate of the faculty, stamped upon the breast of the corpse the seal of
      the university. The body was next carried into the anatomical hall, and
      the cover of the box in which it had been transported was returned to the
      executioner, who remained at some distance for this purpose. If the corpse
      was one that had been decapitated, during these solemn ceremonies the head
      was placed between its legs. Finally, an entertainment with music, often
      furnished by itinerant actors, was given. But this folly was gradually
      discontinued, and by the second half of the sixteenth century public
      dissection was performed without recourse to such mummeries. The price of
      skeletons in those days was high; the University of Hiedelberg, in 1669,
      paid seventy-two dollars for one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practitioners of the sixteenth century were often quite as roving as
      the students and professors, though those who held positions as State
      physicians were bound by contract to a fixed residence for a certain time.
      In 1519 the State physician of Heilbronn received a salary of twenty-one
      dollars per year and his firewood, but could not leave the city over night
      without permission of the burgomaster. Medical attendants of the King of
      Spain were required to kneel down when they felt the king's pulse. There
      were few physicians who acquired wealth, although Fabricius ab
      Aquapendente left a fortune of two hundred thousand ducats.

      The Reform Period is the name which Renouard has given to the time
      beginning with the commencement of the seventeenth century,&mdash;a time
      when the domain of natural science was daily enlarged, and when
      observation had enriched human knowledge with multitudes of new facts,
      some of which harmonized with, and some of which were in opposition to,
      prevailing doctrines. Men whose knowledge<span class="pagenum">151</span><a
      name="link151" id="link151"></a> equaled their genius began to need a
      radical reform, and by such men intellectual improvement was begun by
      which the decrepit theories of the schools of the Middle Ages were
      eradicated and by which there were substituted for them others which
      harmonized much better with known phenomena. To the period of worship of
      ancient authority succeeded one characterized by a desire to shake off the
      yoke of the same, and men now struggled, as it were, to free themselves
      from the tyranny of the past. As Galileo was the torch-bearer for
      regeneration of the knowledge of physics, and as Kepler, and others
      already named, or to be named, did as much for other branches of science,
      so there were not lacking those who broke away from the restraint of
      authority in medicine, and began to beat or choose paths for themselves
      among the facts which experimental science furnished them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the approach of the seventeenth century there was evident improvement
      in both the social and mental status of medical men. While political
      humiliation and exhaustion were everywhere noted, in the field of
      literature it was evident that the line had advanced. What may have been
      the effect of thirty years of religious war, with other political
      struggles carried on under the hypocritical cloak of religion, may be
      imagined, if not fully described; the devastation of whole countries by
      disease, and notably by the plague,&mdash;the poverty and hunger
      consequent upon the ravages of perpetual war (it is stated that even so
      late as 1792 there were still in Saxony 535 wasted and extinct villages),
      to say nothing of the barbarity and immorality resulting therefrom,&mdash;all
      combined to make the early part of the seventeenth century a most mournful
      epoch. It is not strange that, with poverty, superstition and great
      rudeness of manners prevailed, or that trials for witchcraft and
      persecutions by the Jesuit Inquisition were common. That any advance
      should<span class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a>
      have been made under such circumstances speaks well for the progress of
      the human mind. That this advance was slight in Germany and central Europe
      is not strange, though other countries were able to quietly enlarge their
      scientific borders. Now it was that England, Italy, and the Netherlands,
      which took but little part in the warlike struggles of the century,
      acquired leadership in medicine, and were seconded by the French. In Great
      Britain, science had been fostered by various kings, and particularly by
      Charles II, who professed to be something of a chemist; in fact, an
      epidemic of scientific interest fell upon the English court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seventeenth century, in contrast to the idealistic sixteenth,
      witnessed the advent of modern realism in almost all departments of
      thought. Medicine furnished the first example in what we are accustomed
      to-day to speak of as the exact method; hence, the century is of great
      importance, in that physicists and chemists began to be original, instead
      of mere followers of the past. The most notable feature of medicine was
      the promulgation of three medical systems: the pietistically colored
      Paracelsism of Van Hel-mont; the chemical system of Sylvius; and the
      iatro-cliemical system of the physicist and mechanician, Borelli. This
      period is, moreover, illumined by the life of one great practitioner,
      whose name will be imperishable in the history of our art,&mdash;namely,
      Sydenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal tendency of the time was toward skepticism, which had begun
      in the preceding century with Montaigne, and was continued by Charron,
      under the patronage of Queen Marguerite of Navarre; it was the fundamental
      idea of Pierre Bayle, the author of the great dictionary. Opposed thereto
      was the supernatural philosophy, or the theosophic, cabalistic, or mystic.
      The leading exponent of the latter was Boehme, who was a business
      colleague of the celebrated "Meistersinger," Hans Sachs, in Germany, and
      of Blaise Pascal and his contemporary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malebranche,<span class="pagenum">153</span><a name="link153" id="link153"></a>
      in France. The doctrine of Lord Bacon, Lord Verulam (1561-1626), a man who
      showed himself as exalted in mind as he was mean in personal traits, was
      of great importance Bacon is a landmark in history as the defender and
      eulogist of modern realism,&mdash;i.e., of inductive philosophy. While
      personally contributing but little to the advance of science, he taught a
      great method; as Gruen says, he was the philosopher of patents and profit;
      he recognized the compass, the art of printing, and gunpowder as great
      inventions, but placed little value on the discovery of Copernicus, having
      little comprehension of mathematics. Hobbes and Locke went farther into
      realistic philosophy, and the latter was an exponent later of pure
      empiricism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the seventeenth century, also, zoology and botany were largely
      extended. In it lived Swammerdam (1637-1680), famous as a naturalist,
      physiologist, linguist, poet, and <i>savant</i>; there were others, also,
      whose names are better known in the history of collateral science than in
      medicine, and who left conclusive demonstrations in accordance with their
      theories, and made daily use of the microscope, simple as it then was. The
      term "cell" had been introduced by Hooke in 1667, and Malpighi and Grew
      were the founders of the cell-doctrine. The astronomical laws discovered
      by Copernicus changed the course of the world's thought; and now appeared
      the brilliant Kepler (1571-1630), and Galileo (15641642), the defender of
      the Copernican system, and the persecuted discoverer of the law of falling
      bodies, of the thermometer, the telescope, and the movements of Jupiter;
      also, Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), whose discovery of the laws of
      gravitation in 1665 marked an era in the history of science. This century,
      too, gave birth to Romer, who in 1675 calculated the velocity of light;
      Huyghens (1627-1693), who discovered the polarization of light and the
      satellites of Saturn; James Gregory, who in 1663 made<span class="pagenum">154</span><a
      name="link154" id="link154"></a> a reflecting telescope with a metallic
      concave mirror; Torricelli, who in 1643 measured the weight of the air;
      Gascoigne, who invented the micrometer in 1639; and Napier, who invented
      logarithms in 1700.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now chemistry, having ceased to be alchemy, began to don the dignity of a
      science <i>per se</i>, and it may be claimed that medicine derived no
      slight benefit therefrom. Scientific societies and journals arose at this
      period, and were all of good service to medicine in their way. The church
      scented danger to the faith in everything which related to natural
      science, and founded certain secret associations, especially in Italy; the
      Accademia Degli Lyncei, so called from its seal, which bore the image of a
      fox or lynx, founded in Rome in 1603, was one of these. Counter-societies,
      or, rather, societies with opposite purposes, were also started, and the
      original and private so-called Invisible Society, which was originated
      mainly by Milton, in 1645, and remodeled by Charles II in 1662, is now the
      flourishing Royal Society. In France the Academy was founded in 1665 by
      Colbert, but developed its first real activity thirty-five years later.

      Those who to-day are so familiar with the course of the circulation of the
      blood through the arteries and veins find it difficult to understand how
      the recognition of this phenomenon could have been so long delayed; it
      seems so simple, yet to the ancients it was perfectly incompre-hensible!
      Although every one had recognized that blood would flow from an incision,
      few stopped to reason thereupon. From time immemorial it had been supposed
      that the veins had their origin in the liver, and were the only vessels
      which contained blood, since the arteries were always found empty after
      death; the latter were held to contain only air or spirit. The circulation
      was supposed to leave and return to the liver through the venous canals by
      undulating movements similar to those of the waves of the ocean; and this
      was the doctrine of the Asclepiadæ,<span class="pagenum">155</span><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a> and probably of Erasistratus. Galen
      modified this view by showing that the arteries contained blood; he knew
      it was poured into the right cavities of the heart by the great veins, but
      he believed that only a small quantity passed from the right ventricle
      into the lungs, and that the major portion reached the left ventricle by
      passing through pores in the inner ventricular septum. This opinion was
      uncontested until the middle of the sixteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the theologian, Michael Servetus, who, in 1553, perished as the
      victim of Calvin's jealousy, denied the passage of the blood through this
      septum, contending that it was returned from the lungs to the left side of
      the heart by the pulmonary veins. This was a happy thought, and a great
      step toward the truth. Soon after Columbus demonstrated anatomically that
      the conjecture of Servetus was plausible, by showing the function and real
      use of the valves of the heart. Cesalpinus came still nearer to the truth,
      and explained, as did Columbus, the course of the circulation through the
      lungs, but he opined that blood and vital spirits passed from the arteries
      into the veins during sleep, because at that time there was swelling of
      the latter and diminution of the pulse. Valves in the veins were known,
      and it had been shown that ligature of an artery in the living animal
      stopped the flow below it, while if a vein were tied there was shrinkage
      above the ligature, and swelling below it. Such was the state of science
      at the beginning of the seventeenth century; there remained, practically,
      but one step to take,&mdash;to find the true course of the blood.<span

      William Harvey was born in Folkestone, Kent, in 1578 and died in London in
      1637. He first studied at Cambridge, entering at the age of fifteen;
      subsequently traveled in France, Germany, and Italy, remaining in Padua
      from 1599 to 1602, in order to hear the lectures of Fabricius ab
      Aquapendente. With the title of "Doctor" he returned and settled in London
      and soon became a member of the College of Medicine, of which he was made
      a regent in 1613; in time he became physician to James I, and, on the
      demise of this sovereign, to Charlçs I; to the latter he dedicated his
      chief work. During the civil war he was driven from place to place, and,
      finally, to Oxford, where he surrendered himself to the Parliamentary
      troops, after which he again resided in London with his brothers, who had
      become rich. Modesty led him to decline the high distinction of President
      of the College of Physicians, and he lived a quiet and retired life,
      occupied with his studies and, in his later years, investigations in
      mathematics. Soon after 1613 he began, through his lectures, to make known
      the doctrine of the circulation of the blood; but he did not publish the
      results of his researches until 1628, after submitting them to fifteen
      years of proofs and counterproofs<span class="pagenum">157</span><a
      name="link157" id="link157"></a> of every kind. So bitter was the
      opposition of his contemporaries to the new doctrine that he at one time
      lost a part of his practice, and was even held to be demented. It is
      characteristic of the fate of new truths, as well as of that age of
      dominant authority, that his first publication&mdash;<i>Concerning the
      Motions of the Heart and the Blood</i>&mdash;was unable to pass censorship
      in England, and therefore appeared in a foreign country (Frankfort, in
      1628) when he was fifty years old; but his second treatise on the same
      subject, in reply to Riolan, a professor in the Faculty of Paris, was
      published in Cambridge in 1649.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much care and circumspection in search for truth, so much modesty and
      firmness in its demonstration, so much clearness and method in the
      development of his ideas," says Renouard, "should have prepossessed every
      one in favor of the theory of Harvey; but, on the contrary, it caused a
      general stupefaction in the medical world, and gave rise to great
      opposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      This theory, which to-day appears so natural that we conceive with
      difficulty why it was not sooner discovered, was nothing less than a
      revolution in physiology; it excited a tremendous controversy that
      continued more than twenty-five years, and in which mingled every one
      possessed of any pretension to knowledge of anatomy or physiology; even
      naturalists and philosophers took part in the dispute. René Descartes was
      the first to declare in its favor and to support it by experiment; John
      Walæus (Jan de Wale), the celebrated Professor of Anatomy in the
      University of Leyden, confirmed it by new observations; finally Plempius,
      of Louvain, for a time one of the most fiery of opponents, succumbed to
      the truth, and in 1652 passed publicly to the ranks of Harvey's followers&mdash;no
      small triumph!
    </p>
    <p>
      During these long debates Harvey remained always dignified and firm,
      although the early attacks rendered him unduly sensitive regarding others
      which he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      About<span class="pagenum">158</span><a name="link158" id="link158"></a>
      his only answer to the arguments adduced against him, was to add new
      proofs and new experiments to those already published. The only one of his
      adversaries who obtained a direct response was Riolan, who possessed
      immense influence among his contemporaries as a man of attainments; Riolan
      combated with equal violence and obstinacy the other great discovery of
      the age,&mdash;viz., the circulation of the lymph. Harvey ultimately,
      however, had the satisfaction of seeing his theory universally adopted.
      But his services were not limited to this one discovery. He made most
      interesting observations on generation, both in man and in animals; on
      midwifery; and on the structure and diseases of the uterus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intermediary system and bond of union between the arteries and veins,
      so very essential, yet up to this time unknown, was discovered by the
      great Malpighi, who was born in 1628 near Bologna, became professor in its
      university, and discovered in the lungs and mesentery of frogs, in 1661,
      the capillary circulation. He first described the corpuscles of the blood
      in 1665; he also discovered the lung-cells, as well as the cutaneous
      glands, certain portions of the kidney, and the pigmentary layer of the
      skin, named after him (<i>rete Malpighi</i>), which later furnished the
      first explanation of the difference of color in different races.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1690 Leuwenhoek (1632-1723), who had been making observations on the
      larvæ of frogs and other small animals, was able to see with his improved
      microscope the movements of the blood in the small vessels, and gave the
      important testimony of his observations. In 1687 Cowper saw the passage of
      the arterial into the venous current in the mesentery of a cat. The
      capillary connection between the two vascular systems was first
      demonstrated by Marchetti, but was best shown by Ruysch (1638-1731),
      professor at Amsterdam, the famous inventor of minute injections, who
      greatly advanced anatomy by the formation of collections, one of which was
      brought into Russia by Peter<span class="pagenum">159</span><a
      name="link159" id="link159"></a> the Great at an expense of about
      seventy-five thousand dollars. The Russian transporters of the collection,
      however, drank the alcohol in which many of the preparations were
      preserved, and a portion of the specimens was thus ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further illustration and amplification of Harvey's views came from various
      sources; the last, perhaps, from Nich-olaus Steno (1638-1686), who was
      first a professor in Copenhagen, then a bishop and peripatetic converter
      of heretics. Steno first proved the heart to be a muscle that contracts
      actively and expels the blood. The duct that bears his name was discovered
      during his residence in Leyden or at Amsterdam. His name is written also
      "Stenson."
    </p>
    <p>
      While ancient anatomists were able to describe in a general way the form
      of the lungs, their location, consistency, the ring-like structure of the
      trachea, and the first division of the bronchi, they did not go farther,
      but blindly accepted the prevalent theory that the bronchial tubes
      anastomosed with the terminal pulmonary veins, and that in this way
      atmospheric fluid was conveyed from the respiratory organs into the heart.
      On such vague and erroneous data was constructed the theory that the air
      was drawn into the lungs by the heat of the heart, which was the reservoir
      of the vital spirits; that in penetrating through the smaller tubes it was
      rarefied, its thinnest part passing into the heart, where it served as
      material for the formation of the vital spirit, its grosser part being
      exhaled. In other words, respiration was supposed to have two purposes one
      to refresh the lungs, which, being porous and inflammable, would otherwise
      take fire from the heart, or focus of animal heat; the other to furnish
      the pneuma, or ether, which was employed by the heart in the formation of
      animal spirits. Harvey's discovery upset all this, in great measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next it was shown that pulmonary veins carried nothing to the heart except
      blood. And now, during this Reform<span class="pagenum">160</span><a
      name="link160" id="link160"></a> Period, the purpose of the movements of
      the chest was better studied, for Borelli, Helvetius, and Haller made many
      experiments, as the result of which it was determined that during
      inspiration the thorax is enlarged in all directions, and during
      expiration partly collapsed by relaxation of muscles, and that there never
      is any empty space between the lungs and the sides of the chest; further,
      that air is drawn into the chest by the tendency of all gases or fluids to
      maintain an equilibrium, or, in other words, because Nature abhors a
      vacuum. This being settled, various pneumatic theories were adopted and
      abandoned, all of which had subsequently to give way before a knowledge of
      what really occurs. The truth was conceived of by Mayow in 1668. It had
      been noticed that blood which appeared black in issuing from the veins,
      became red in contact with the air, and direct observation proved a
      similar change of color to take place during its passage from the
      pulmonary veins during life. Goodwin, opening the thorax of a frog, was
      the first to see this, and Hessenfratz filled a silk bladder with venous
      blood, and, plunging it into an atmosphere of oxygen, saw the blood change
      from black to red. In this way and by the later labors of Bichat and
      Lavoisier were clearly established the mechanism and the purpose of the
      function of respiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of the lymphatic vessels and their purpose was scarcely less
      remarkable than that of the circulation, though marked by less eclat
      because it was not the work of one man, but a matter of slow development.
      Herophilus and Erasistratus had seen white vessels connected with the
      lymph-nodes in the mesentery of animals, and supposed them to be arteries
      full of air. Galen disputed this, for he believed that the intestinal
      chyle was carried by the veins of the mesentery into the liver. In 1563
      Eustachius described the thoracic duct in the horse. In 1622 Aselli,
      Professor of Anatomy at Milan, discovered the lacteal vessels in a dog
      which had been killed immediately after partaking<span class="pagenum">161</span><a
      name="link161" id="link161"></a> of food; having pricked one of these by
      mistake, he saw a white fluid issue from it. Repeating the experiment, he
      became certain that the white threads were vessels which drew the chyle
      from the intestines. He observed the valves with which they are supplied,
      and supposed these vessels all met in the pancreas and continued on into
      the liver. In 1647 Pecquet, while still a student at Montpellier,
      discovered the lymph-reservoir, or <i>receptaculum chyli</i>, and the
      canal which leads from it (the thoracic duct), which he followed to its
      termination in the left subclavian vein. Having ligated the duct, he saw
      it swell below and become empty above the ligature. He studied the courses
      of the lacteals, and convinced himself that they all entered into the
      common reservoir. This discovery gave the last blow to the ancient theory
      which attributed to the liver the function of blood-making, and confirmed
      the doctrine of Harvey. Strangely enough, the latter united with Riolan in
      opposing the discovery of Pecquet and denying its significance. From this
      time the lymphatic vessels and glands became objects of common interest
      and were investigated by many anatomists,&mdash;by Bartholin, Ruysch, the
      Hunters, Hewson, and, above all, by Mascagni, who was the first to give a
      graphic description of the whole lymphatic apparatus.
    </p>

      The ancients confounded, under the name "neuron," nerves, tendons,
      ligaments, and membranes; even Aristotle regarded the brain as an inert
      mass devoid of sensation, and supposed the nerves to originate in the
      heart. Rufus, of Ephesus, remarked that Herophilus distinguished three
      sorts of nerves,&mdash;the first serving for sensation and motion and
      proceeding from the brain and spinal marrow, the second and third serving
      to unite bones and muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galen also shared in this error, but, nevertheless, described the
      brain-membranes and the difference between white and gray matter; he
      supposed the cerebrum to be the seat of the soul and origin of sensory
      nerves, and that the cerebellum<span class="pagenum">162</span><a
      name="link162" id="link162"></a> gave rise to nerves of motion; the
      pulsation of the cerebrum exposed was held to be a sort of brain
      respiration. Galen came very near recognizing the distinction between
      nerves and tendons, but nevertheless confused them. The anatomists of the
      sixteenth century described certain portions of the nervous system with,
      more exactness than did Galen, but not with such positiveness as to
      prevent Cesalpinus from renewing the Aristotelian theory that the heart
      was the origin of sensation and the seat of the soul. Nearly two centuries
      later Baglivi advanced a theory which referred vital movement to the heart
      and the dura mater.

      The progress which accrued to comparative anatomy and physiology, and the
      experiments which were made on animals, during this period, shed a great
      deal of light upon the nervous system. The researches of Vieussens,
      Haller, Meckel, Vicq d'Azyr, Scarpa, Soemmering, and others had already
      rendered it manifest that the brain was the organ of sensation and
      voluntary motion, and Bichat had proposed to divide the nervous system
      into cerebrospinal and sympathetic branches.

      Now, too, Kepler discovered that the crystalline lens was not the seat of
      vision, as had been supposed, but that its function, like that of other
      lenses, is the refraction of light. He observed that the image of objects
      is depicted upon the retina, and (with Schemer) demonstrated that the
      expansion of the optic nerve in the retina is the essential part in the
      organ of sight. Obviously, also, interest in the anatomy of the eye, which
      these observations everywhere stimulated, was, in a great measure, aided
      by the researches of Newton on light and color.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, too, Casserius and others studied the auditory apparatus
      and described the ossicles, the small muscles of the internal ear, and the
      semicircular canals; they even followed the acoustic nerve. By the
      researches of a number of French and Italian anatomists it was likewise<span
      class="pagenum">163</span><a name="link163" id="link163"></a> established
      that the true seat of hearing lies within the internal ear, the external
      parts being merely of assistance in conducting sound.
    </p>

      Thomas Willis was one of the first to consider the brain as an assemblage
      of organs and to assign special functions to certain of its divisions; he
      thus became a pioneer in cerebral localization, although most of his
      conjectures were inaccurate or fanciful. The workings of the brain were
      also studied by Pinel and others, who observed that in certain conditions
      of mania or partial insanity some of the mental faculties&mdash;such as
      memory, judgment, imagination, or will&mdash;were abolished or suspended,
      while other faculties were preserved; hence it was inferred that each
      faculty must have its own seat. The views thus enunciated were carried to
      an absurd degree by Gall, and later by Spurzheim, who made an entirely new
      classification, believing the cranium to be molded in a reasonably exact
      manner upon the brain, and that, by inspection of the exterior, the
      character of a given individual could be read. They thus founded the
      pseudoscience denominated phrenology, which we now know has practically
      nothing to justify itself.

      About the middle of the seventeenth century Glisson (a professor in the
      University of Oxford) recognized a property pertaining to all living
      tissue, which he termed irritability, and which he regarded as sufficient
      cause for all the phenomena of life; he enunciated certain views that, in
      times past, have had an important bearing upon the pathology of disease,
      but which were forgotten for sixty years or more until revamped by the
      Dutch anatomist, Goerter. It was the latter, with the great Haller, who,
      by a series of very ingenious experiments, elevated the suppositions of
      Glisson to the dignity of demonstrated facts. In 1747 the results of
      Haller's researches were published under the modest title of <i>First
      Lines in Physiology</i>; the author was, in fact, the great exponent of
      the doctrine of irritability in<span class="pagenum">164</span><a
      name="link164" id="link164"></a> neurophysiology, and for this deserves to
      be remembered wherever the history of our art is spoken of. This theory of
      irritability was applied to pathology by Fabre, of Paris, who refuted the
      mechanical theory of Boerhaave on inflammation, proving that the latter
      proceeds not from obstruction of the capillaries, but from exaltation of
      their irritability. It was also applied in many ways by Bichat, who
      enjoyed a brief, though memorable, career. The theory of irritability,
      along with the truths established by John Hunter in his researches on the
      blood, made a very distinct advance in the physiological knowledge of the
      seventeenth century, and the researches of those who contributed so much
      to its advance are well worthy of study even at the present day. In this
      line of investigation should, perhaps, also be mentioned the names of
      Winslow, Albinus, the two Monroes, besides vicq d'Azyr, and others already
      named.

      I have so far discussed the development of theories and researches of
      individuals. During the earlier portion of the seventeenth century there
      happened something which gave to materia medica a remedy so valuable, and
      which attracted such wide-spread attention, that it deserves special
      mention, I refer to the discovery of that great febrifuge, Peruvian bark.
      Malarial fevers had been known as early as the time of Hippocrates, and
      were universally treated largely with purgatives, sometimes with
      venesections. There had been no notable improvement in the management of
      pyrexias of this class down to 1638, when the Countess of Cinchon, wife of
      the Viceroy of Peru, became a prey to a fever which nothing could remove.
      It is said a Spaniard learned from the natives the secret of the bark, and
      advised its employment, whereby the countess recovered her health. This is
      the generally received account, although it has been widely discredited,
      and Humboldt expresses decided doubts as to the source whence the first
      knowledge of the bark was derived. Be this as it may, however,<span
      class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165" id="link165"></a> it is
      certain that, in 1639, the countess and her physician, de Vega, imported
      into Spain a quantity of ground Peruvian bark, and distributed it to
      various persons, though it was not made an article of general commerce
      until ten years later, when it was exploited by the Jesuits, who had
      received a large supply; in Spain it was known as the "countess's powder,"
      and in Italy as "Jesuit" or "cardinal" powder. Being very high-priced, it
      was soon so sophisticated as to be quite unreliable. Condamine, the
      botanist, having been sent to America for other purposes, determined the
      botanical position of the tree and described several species of cinchona,
      one of which is known by his name. To him is due the generic title
      bestowed in acknowledgment of the services rendered by the countess, who
      introduced the bark into Europe. Many vain attempts were made to determine
      the chemical composition of the powder, and it remained for two French
      chemists to isolate and separate its most important alkaloid. The first
      who wrote upon the therapy of cinchona was Barba, a Spanish physician,
      whose work was printed in Seville in 1642. After its introduction into
      England Peruvian bark fell into disrepute, owing to improper
      administration, whereby death was caused in certain instances; and it was
      this latter fact that instigated Sydenham to investigate it still more
      accurately. There has never been introduced into medicine any one drug
      which has proved itself so generally valuable and so widely effective as
      cinchona and its products.

      As little progress had been made in obstetrics as in other branches of
      applied medicine or surgery. The custom of employing midwives was general,
      and these, for the most part, were ignorant and filthy old women, slaves
      of routine procedures that had obtained from time immemorial. Educated
      accoucheurs were called only in extraordinary cases; but with progress the
      prejudice which excluded educated physicians from the practice of
      midwifery gradually gave<span class="pagenum">166</span><a name="link166"
      id="link166"></a> way, and there was opened for obstetrics a new era. In
      the beginning of the seventeenth century the initiative was taken by
      Louise Bourgeois, the <i>sage femme</i> of Marie de Medicis, who in 1626
      published a collection of observations concerning sterility, abortion,
      fecundity, accouchement, and diseases of women and children generally; it
      embodied several distinctly new ideas. A little later (in 1668),
      Mauriceau, of Paris, chief accoucheur to the Hôtel-Dieu, published his
      treatise on diseases of pregnancy and childbirth, which was translated
      into all the languages of Europe and became a powerful agent for good, not
      alone that it represented an advance in knowledge, but it stimulated such
      rivals and successors as Devanter, Peu, Paul Portal, and Delamotte to
      further research. About this time the Chamberlains, an English family
      devoted to the practice of midwifery, invented an instrument to facilitate
      the extraction of the foetal head when arrested, and one of them went to
      Paris, and, failing of success there, went on to Holland, where he sold
      his secret to two Dutch practitioners, who kept it only too faithfully. In
      1721, Palfvn, a surgeon of Ghent, while seeking to fathom the device of
      the Chamberlains, conceived a <i>tire tête</i> (literally a head-drawer)
      composed of two steel spoons, and hastened to publish an account thereof,&mdash;a
      praiseworthy act, whereby he merits distinction as the inventor of the
      forceps. As modified by Smellie in England and Levret in France, the
      obstetrical forceps ranks among the most useful discoveries of modern
      surgery, and, although not in common use until about a century ago, it may
      be said that the invention has been the means of saving the lives of
      countless women and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical jurisprudence also seems to have had its beginning during this
      century. It had long been the practice to summon physicians to court in
      order to enlighten the judiciary in questions demanding particular
      knowledge in physics and medicine; indeed, the practice began<span
      class="pagenum">167</span><a name="link167" id="link167"></a> under the
      first Christian emperors, and owes its origin to ecclesiastical authority.
      Charlemagne confirmed in this regard what Justinian was perhaps the first
      to ordain. The tribunal of Châtelet, according to Renouard, appears to
      have been the first which comprehended the great utility of consultation
      with expert physicians; an edict of Philip le Bel, in 1311, qualified
      Master John Potard with the title "Sworn Surgeon of Châtelet", and the
      constitution promulgated by Charles V, in 1552, gave great importance to
      medical jurisprudence, as it treated in detail of infanticide, wounds,
      poisons, abortion, and other such crimes. Early in the seventeenth century
      Fidelis collated all that had been written on this subject, and thus
      published the first special treatise on legal medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some writers claim to have discovered traces of clinical teaching in the
      history of Arabian universities, but, as Renouard says, the presence of a
      few pupils during visitations and consultations no more constituted real
      clinical teaching than the practice adopted by some practitioners of
      ancient Rome of being ever surrounded by a group of spectators whom they
      dignified with the title of disciples. The first attempt at real clinical
      teaching appears to have been in the hospital of St. Francis, in Padua, in
      1558, by Botoni and Oddi. About the beginning of the seventeenth century
      Otto de Heurne, of the University of Leyden, introduced bedside
      instruction, which was continued by le Boe, sometimes called Sylvius, with
      the result of drawing-large crowds of students to Leyden from 1658 to
      1672. Notwithstanding the success attained, the practice was neglected by
      the successors of Sylvius until renewed by Boerhaave, who, invested with
      several functions at the University of Leyden, also occupied the chair of
      medicine. So great was the renown of Boerhaave that, despite the poverty
      of the resources of the Leyden hospital, people came to consult him from
      the most distant countries, and he was a correspondent of several crowned
      heads, even of the Pope, although<span class="pagenum">168</span><a
      name="link168" id="link168"></a> himself a Protestant. During his life and
      long afterward he exerted an immense influence in medicine, and while,
      perhaps, inferior in genius to some of his contemporaries, he had a wider
      reputation, and his doctrines prevailed longer. The great success of his
      clinics decided in favor of this method of teaching, and in 1715 the Pope
      established in Rome a similar institution, under the direction of the
      celebrated Lancisi. Soon Edinburgh, Vienna, Pavia, and other universities
      followed suit, the first clinical chair in Paris being held by Corvisart,
      and the first in Vienna by Van Swieten. After the demise of Boerhaave, the
      school of Leyden rapidly declined, while those of Edinburgh and Vienna
      became rivals for the first place. It is thus seen that after an
      interruption of more than two thousand years clinical teaching was revived
      and became more brilliant than ever before.

      I now propose to recount the methods and deeds of some of those concerned
      in the development of systems, so called, and make mention of the most
      prominent medical men in national and historical order. This will not
      prevent going back to philosophical conclusions or reflections upon the
      philosophy of the history of medicine, when it may seem wise so to
      digress.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, of the system of J. B. Van Helmont, which in its day was most
      highly regarded, and which seems to have been, in some measure, a
      rearrangement of the views of Paracelsus into a mystic and pietistic
      system based upon mechanical principles. Van Helmont was born in Brussels
      in 1578, and was so precocious that he entered the University of Louvain
      at an age which would have enabled him, had he so desired, to obtain the
      degree of Magister when only seventeen years old, he deemed the degree
      frivolous. He had studied mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and
      astrology. Going now to the Jesuits, who at that time, even, taught music,
      he soon became dissatisfied, and turned to the study of stoical
      philosophy. Believing that the<span class="pagenum">169</span><a
      name="link169" id="link169"></a> Capuchins (who were mere lascivious
      gluttons, and considered even washing unchristian) were the true stoics,
      he sought to join this order, but ere long abandoned them and resumed his
      studies in law, botany, and medicine. For the latter Van Helmont had at
      first little respect, since his studies in this line did not enable him to
      rid himself of the itch. He soon again lapsed to the monastics, and came
      to the conclusion that wisdom, like the grace of God, was obtainable only
      by fasting, supplication, and poverty; accordingly he practiced medicine
      among the poor as a labor of love (having received his degree of Doctor in
      1599). During his travels he became familiar with the writings of
      Paracelsus, which he studied zealously. Finally he settled down in
      Vilvorde, where he practiced medicine and chemistry until his death (in
      164-4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most "systems," that of Van Helmont is valued only as an expression
      of the spirit of the age, since it embodied largely the pantheism of
      Paracelsus, merely cloaked with a more religious or monkish dress. He held
      that the general cause of disease was the fall of man; though there also
      figured a subsidiary cause, which he denominated Archeus,&mdash;a faculty
      of appetite seated in the spleen or in the stomach; thus dropsy was a
      hindrance of renal excretion by the enraged Archeus. Demons, witches, and
      ghosts were included in Van Helmont's system as causes of disease. Indeed,
      the man seems to have been a second Paracelsus, lacking only in the
      dishonesty and bombast of the latter. He had no followers of any
      prominence, and the "system" soon lapsed into obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chemical, or Iatrochemical, System was originated by le Bôe, commonly
      known as Sylvius (but who must not be confounded with the great anatomist
      of the same name). Le Bôe was born in Hanau in 161-4; studied in Paris,
      Leyden, and Basel; received his doctorate from the latter university at
      the age of twenty, and practiced in Switzerland with great success until
      1660, when he accepted<span class="pagenum">170</span><a name="link170"
      id="link170"></a> a professorship in Leyden; here he was distinguished for
      his eloquence, wealth, and sociability, as well as for the great number of
      pupils that were attracted by his clinical method of teaching. His system
      embraced a peculiar phantasy, being based upon the elements of chemistry,
      the new knowledge of the circulation, the latest physiological teachings,
      and the old doctrine of the spirituous or innate heat of the heart, which
      he claimed to have felt with his finger. He asserted his theories were
      founded upon experience, but the truth is, they were inaccurate deductions
      from experimental observations, many of which were wholly irrelevant. The
      majority of diseases, he taught, were produced by excess of acidity or
      alkalinity. For him, the three great fluids of the body were the saliva,
      the pancreatic fluid, and the bile, while health consisted in the
      undisturbed performance in the body of the process of fermentation; and
      the saliva was supposed to give rise to hectic fevers, because such
      manifest exacerbation after eating. Stereotyped theory and equally
      stereotyped therapeutics gained for him, for a short time, a large
      following, but later raised numerous opponents, who alleged that his
      system caused as many human lives as the whole thirty years' war. He died
      in 1672.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the same iatrochemical school is generally assigned Thomas Willis, born
      in Oxford in 1622 (died in 1675), who rendered great service to anatomy,
      especially to anatomy of the nervous system, although his teaching was
      disfigured by certain unsupported theories. Like Van Helmont, he had been
      destined for theology, but turned his attention to medicine. Ultimately he
      became Professor of Philosophy in the University of Oxford. He first
      described the so-called circle of Willis, whence its name; also ascribed
      diseases, especially those of the blood, to fermentation, in which the
      vital spirits played the chief part. He accounted for hysteria, for
      instance, by the union of the spiritus with imperfectly purified blood.

      class="pagenum">171</span><a name="link171" id="link171"></a> of the
      Iatromathematical, or Iatro-mechanical, or Iatrophysical School devoted
      chief consideration to the solid parts of the economy, whose form and
      function it strove to discover and demonstrate by the aid of exact
      methods,&mdash;that is, by calculation and physical apparatus. Thus, it
      explained digestion as mechanical trituration; secretions were referred to
      variation in resistance of parts in the vascular system; warmth was
      supposed to be due to friction of the blood-corpuscles; health consisted
      in the undisturbed performance of the physical and mechanical processes of
      the body. Diseases were explained inversely: the blood, under diseased
      conditions, was held to contain pointed and angular crystals, which
      irritated as they passed through the pores, or disturbed because they
      could not so pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first to enunciate these views was Santoro, or Sanctorius, who
      flourished from 1561 to 1635, and was for a while professor at Padua. He
      taught how to investigate the pulse by an instrument of his own
      contrivance, and how to study the temperature by means of a species of
      thermometer, which was probably his own invention. (This instrument, by
      the way, was invented about this time; Drebbel [1572-1634] is regarded as
      the inventor of the air-thermometer, Galileo [1574-1642] of the<span
      class="pagenum">172</span><a name="link172" id="link172"></a>
      spirit-thermometer, and Roemer [1644-1710] of the mercurial thermometer.)
      Santoro studied the phenomenon of transpiration, and constructed apparatus
      for bathing bed-ridden individuals; he found that in twenty-four hours the
      insensible transpiration through the skin amounted to 1 1/4 kilogrammes,&mdash;which
      result, compared with the results of the present day, determined by the
      most complete observations, is only twenty per cent, too high, and proves
      how accurately he investigated. The important rôle of the perspiration,
      which he pointed out, was made use of by the iatrochemists to vindicate
      their terrific sweat-cures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Borelli (1608-1679), of Naples, is usually regarded, however, as the
      founder of the iatromechanical school. Of a quarrelsome disposition, he
      could not stay long in any one place, though he ultimately settled in
      Rome, where he joined the circle of <i>savants</i> who gathered round
      Christina, the daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, who had become a convert to
      Catholicism. Finally Borelli entered a monastery. His services related
      mainly to physiology, where, like Descartes, he followed purely
      mathematical principles; he explained the action of the muscles by the
      laws of the lever, calculated the mechanical work done by the heart, and
      correctly ascribed inspiration to muscular action. He was the opponent of
      iatrochemistry, and claimed there was no such thing as corruption of the
      blood. His pupils and followers&mdash;like Bellini (1643-1704). of
      Florence, who became professor in Pisa at the early age of nineteen, and
      Baglivi (1668-1707), a pupil of Malpighi, and a man of universal education&mdash;carried
      out and elaborated the first expressions of this author. Borelli was the
      author of the oft-quoted maxim: "He who diagnoses well cures well."
    </p>
    <p>
      The iatromathematical system held ground for some time in Italy, and also
      found followers elsewhere. For instance, Dodart (1664-1707). of Paris,
      explained the voice on the mechanical principles enunciated by Borelli and
      by<span class="pagenum">173</span><a name="link173" id="link173"></a>
      Quesnay (1694-1774). the tirst permanent secretary of the Academy of
      Surgery in Paris. In England this explanation was adopted by a number of
      followers, none of whom, however, was eminent enough to justify special
      mention here. In Germany it obtained a certain amount of favor, but seems
      not to have attracted any very eminent disciples.

      The iatromechanical school ran a course not unprofit' able to science, yet
      was unfruitful of real advance in the domain of practical medicine. The
      man of this particular age, who, more than any other, exerted an influence
      destined to be prolonged even to the present time, and probably much
      longer, who had a cool, clear, and unprejudiced spirit, and who sought the
      true value of medicine, and recompense for the same in the benefits which
      it brings to the sick, without scorning or neglecting its scientific side,
      was Thomas Sydenham, bora at Winford Eagle in 1624. a student at Oxford in
      1642, and recipient of a bachelor's degree of medicine in 1648.

      fifteen years of his life we know practically nothing of, save that he
      spent some time in Montpellier pursuing his medical studies. In 1663 he
      became a member of the Royal College of Physicians, but did not take his
      degree of Doctor until 1676,&mdash;thirteen years before his death. His
      chief work&mdash;<i>Medical Observations</i>&mdash;is said to have been
      originally written in English, and translated into Latin; it first
      appeared in 1666,&mdash;the year when fire and plague devastated London.
      He died of gout in 1689, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. During the
      earliest years of the plague in London he fled, as was the general custom
      of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      His model was Hippocrates. In pathology he was a humoralist without being
      a theorist. He knew only one standard,&mdash;observation and experience.
      Sharing the opinions of his day, he laid but little weight upon anatomy
      and physiology; yet he recognized their value when employed in the
      production of hypotheses. He conceived of disease as active, operative,&mdash;a
      natural effort of the body to remove morbid material from the blood; if
      this effort is violent and speedy, we have to do, he says, with an acute
      disease, but if slow and difficult, the condition is chronic. Fever was
      supposed to result mostly from cold or from epidemic influences. As causes
      of disease, he considered unknown influences and changes of the atmosphere
      very important. In his special pathology "inflammation of the blood"
      played the chief rôle, and upon it were made to depend nearly all acute
      and some chronic diseases. He arrived at what he called the "healing power
      of Nature," for which he made great claims in his description and
      observation of epidemics: but he believed there always remained a good
      deal for the physician to do, and in treating syphilis he even gave
      mercury until two kilogrammes of saliva were discharged daily. As compared
      with the therapeutics of that day his were manifestly simple,&mdash;and
      yet he employed, for example,<span class="pagenum">175</span><a
      name="link175" id="link175"></a> eighteen different herbs in one
      prescription, and that merely an ointment. The unreliability of the action
      of drugs induced him to rely upon specifics, as did Paracelsus, but he
      acknowledged only one such,&mdash;the then new discovery, cinchona,&mdash;not
      even allowing mercury such a position in the treatment of syphilis. Such
      drugs as he chose were mainly from the vegetable kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great importance of Sydenham, and all his statements, so far as we are
      concerned, centres about his struggle for the elucidation of the healing
      power of Nature, and for simple observation and simpler treatment, as
      opposed to the overgrown luxuriance of previous systems and theories. He
      became the standard-bearer of his age in his return to Hippocrates's
      method and art of healing, which are founded on the nature of things and
      on the limits of human ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sydenham was vehemently opposed by Richard Morton (1625-1648), of London,
      who, like Fernel, considered all diseases to be a poisoning of the vital
      spirits. Sydenham was also antagonized by Gideon Harvey, who ridiculed his
      medical contemporaries without stint, because most of them, for febrile
      disease, gave cathartics from the second day, and began treatment with
      emetics. With delightful satire Harvey divided the physicians of the day
      into six classes: the Ferrea, Asinaria, Jesuitica, Aquaria, Laniaria, and
      Stercoraria, according as their favorite systems of treatment were the
      administration of iron, asses' milk, cinchona, mineral water, venesection,
      or purgatives.

      Sir Thomas Browne (1605-1682), who still enjoys a great reputation, was
      the author of the works entitled <i>Religlo Medici and Inquiries into
      Vulgar and Common Errors</i>. The latter appeared in 1646, but does not
      seem to have protected its author from the worst error of his age,&mdash;viz.,
      superstition,&mdash;since, in 1664, he swore that two condemned old women
      were actual witches.

      considered the progress of medicine during the seventeenth century, it may
      be well to glance likewise at surgical progress. Among the Italians
      Santoro, already spoken of as the inventor of various instruments, should
      be mentioned; also Valsalva, who obtained a sound reputation as an
      operator, employed the ligature, and recommended a starvation plan for
      treating aneurism; Magati (1579-1647). who contended against the abuses of
      treating wounds by filling them with plasters, balsam, poultices, tents,
      etc., and of changing the dressing several times a day.&mdash;once in four
      days was better, he said; Severino (1580-1656), first a lawyer, then a
      professor at Xaples, and later an eminent surgeon, a good anatomist, and a
      particular friend of the actual cautery; Marchetti (1589-1673), a bold,
      versatile operator of Padua; and Borri, of Milan (1625-1695), skilled as
      an operator and an oculist but better known because of his sad fate, since
      he died in the prison of the Inquisition, alter a prison-life of
      twenty-five years, on account of too liberal religious views. There were
      also numerous other Italian surgeons who made a name, especially in
      plastic surgery, and particularly in that branch of it named rhinoplasty,
      by whose efforts one method of manufacturing a new nose came to be known
      as the "Italian method."

      France, we must remember, was the home, during this century of Richelieu.
      Mazarin. Louis XIV. Corneille. Racine. Molière. Fénelou. La Fontaine.
      Boileau, Bossuet, and many other men eminent in literature and science.
      During this century the French laid the foundation for that leadership in
      surgery which they maintained for nearly two centuries. Let us mention,
      among their surgeons. Morel, who invented the tourniquet at the siege of
      Besançon, in the year 1674. There was also Jean Baptiste Denis (who died
      in 1704), physician to Louis XIV. who performed the first transfusion of
      blood in man. (Transfusion of the blood of the young into the veins of the
      old for the purposes of rejuvenation,<span class="pagenum">177</span><a
      name="link177" id="link177"></a> was recommended by Libavius, in 1715, and
      Colle, of Padua, gave it new support by describing a method for its
      performance. In 1729 Boyle practiced transfusion on dogs. The London
      faculty sought the value of the operation after excessive haemorrhage, and
      Edmund King, physician to Charles II, in 1665 practiced transfusion from
      vein to vein. But Denis was the first to carry out the operation with
      lamb's blood upon a patient sinking under excessive venesection,&mdash;an
      operation which was very much abused at this time.) It was in this century
      that the French family of lithotomists&mdash;the Collots&mdash;distinguished
      themselves in their special line. The last member of the family, Francois,
      died in 1706. Their specialty must have found, at that time, considerable
      more material than comes to the front to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the general surgeons of France were de Marque (1618), who
      distinguished himself as a bandager; Bienaise, who invented the bistoury
      caché (1601-1631); de Launay (1649), monk and lithotomist; Goursaud, who
      survived his century, and who was the first to describe stercoral
      incarceration; Duverney, who demonstrated the growth and nutrition of the
      bones by periosteum; Lambert, who practiced injections in hydrocele;
      Andry, of Lyons, who wrote of orthopaedic surgery and originated the name
      <i>orthopaedics</i>; Pierre Dionis (who died in 1718), surgeon to the
      Empress Maria Theresa, famous in his art, and who first emphasized the
      effects of rickets upon the pelvis; and Boulot, better known as Beaulieu
      (1671-1714). who advanced himself from being a soldier and a day-laborer
      to become a physician, a famous lithotomist and surgeon. He finally joined
      the Franciscan order, where he obtained the name of Frère Jacques, under
      which title he passed for the inventor of lateral lithotomy. Then there
      were Saviard (1656-1702), surgeon-in-chief in the Hôtel-Dieu, who, among
      other things, determined the seat of hernial strangulation to be often in
      the neck of the sac; and Georges<span class="pagenum">178</span><a
      name="link178" id="link178"></a> Mareschal (1658-1736), surgeon to Louis
      XIV, one of the founders of the Academy of Surgery, who has a record of
      eight lithotomies performed in half an hour, and who became famous for his
      services in improving the schools of surgery in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this (the seventeenth) century, also, ophthalmology was much cultivated
      in France, although it was assigned to the despised surgeons. Those who
      won most renown in this line were Maitre Jean and Brisseau, who divide the
      honor of first recognizing the seat of true cataract. During this period,
      also, Duverney, Professor of Anatomy at Paris, was the first to
      systematically describe diseases of the ear in accordance with their
      anatomical seat.

      In Spain scholarship sank more rapidly during this century than among any
      other people in history, due mainly to the loss of their political
      supremacy and their commerce to the Dutch and English, and to the utter
      failure, at home, of their efforts to introduce true unity of faith. In
      these efforts the industrious Moors were excluded, under Philip III. In
      art they maintained their standing,&mdash;attaining, in fact, in Murillo,
      the acme of their fame; but in other branches of industry they rapidly
      degenerated. Students of history will readily understand how little
      leisure the Spaniards had at this time to devote to the cultivation of
      science, including medicine and surgery. Of the two men who are mentioned
      during this century as Spanish surgeons, namely, Almeida and Ayala, we
      know practically nothing.

      The Germans gained no such store of knowledge from their experience during
      the Thirty Years' War as did the French during their campaigns. The
      barber-surgeons, for the most part, still reigned supreme, and their guild
      contained some men of ability and independence of thought. The most
      notable man of the times was Fabricius Hildanus (1560-1634). Of him,
      however, I have already spoken as belonging rather to the previous
      century. He was the first learned German surgeon recognized and esteemed
      as such by his contemporaries. He was distinguished, also, as an oculist
      and aurist, and removed a particle of iron from the cornea by means of a
      magnet. A man of great operative genius, and a born surgeon, was Purmann
      (1648-1721), who greatly lamented the low condition of surgery in Germany,
      and regarded a knowledge of anatomy as the prime requisite for the
      surgeon; he employed the speculum in the diagnosis of syphilis, although
      it has been Ricord's boast that this was his own idea. Scultetus
      (1595-1645), of Ulm, was a famous surgical writer of this period, and a
      bandage of his devising is still in frequent use, and bears his name.
      Murait, of Zürich, was also a capable surgeon (1655-1733).<span

      The Dutch had but few men during this century who enjoyed any reputation
      as surgeons. The best among them was Rau (1658-1719), who, from being a
      poor boy, became a barber, traveled extensively, and was finally made
      Professor of Anatomy and Surgery in Leyden, where he introduced the
      innovation of teaching practical surgery upon the cadaver. He was
      especially famous as a lithotomist after the method of Frère Jacques,
      although he did not give instruction on this subject in his lectures.

      By the way, it is an interesting fact that the clinical histories of many
      operations for stone during the seventeenth century were related in verse,
      and illustrated with plates. Harvey's vivisections were also related in
      verse.

      Now, for the first time, do we begin to hear of English surgeons and
      English surgery. The most prominent, as well as almost the earliest, was
      Richard Wiseman (1595-1686), ordinary surgeon of James I, called sometimes
      the "Pride of England" and sometimes the "Paré of England,"&mdash;a bold,
      judicious operator, who took hold of every novelty and who accepted the
      ligature of Paré (always having the actual cautery at hand, in case the
      ligature should fail); he also amputated through sound parts,<span
      class="pagenum">181</span><a name="link181" id="link181"></a> favored
      operating for strangulated hernia, and employed the trephine zealously.
      The first recorded operation for external urethrotomy for the relief of
      stricture is mentioned in Wiseman's writings.

      There were also William Cowper (1666-1709), a famous anatomist and
      surgeon; and Woolhouse, a famous, but ignorant, itinerant oculist. Sir
      Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul's, was the first who devoted
      attention to injecting medicine into the veins,&mdash;a subject studied
      again much later and recently once more taken up. His example (in 1667)
      was followed by others, whose experiments demonstrated, as we know to-day,
      that the effects which follow the intravenous administration of drugs are
      the same as follow administration by the mouth.

      Midwifery during the seventeenth century advanced even more rapidly than
      its mother-science surgery. The accouchement of women was intrusted in
      many cases to the care of educated men, who contributed not a little to
      the art. Anatomy and physiology contributed also their quota to a clearer
      knowledge of these diseases. The obstetric forceps were for so long a time
      kept secret that they were of small benefit at first to the obstetric art.
      Among the French who were especially prominent as promoters of midwifery
      must be mentioned Marguerite de la Marche, chief midwife of the
      Hôtel-Dieu; Francois Mauriceau, President of the College of St. Come;
      Jules Clement Delamotte, who was also a skillful surgeon; and Portal, who
      first proposed version by one foot Among the Germans a few midwives
      distinguished themselves as independent observers, most of all Justine
      Siegemundin, daughter of a minister, who devoted herself to midwifery with
      such success that she became court midwife; she recommended puncture of
      the membranes for the production of artificial delivery, and especially
      advocated bimanual version.

    <p>
      But, perhaps, the most significant advances were made in the direction of
      studies in anatomy, physiology, and pathology.<span class="pagenum">183</span><a
      name="link183" id="link183"></a> The history of the circulation we have
      already taken up. After Harvey's time, and largely because of his
      researches, physiologists were divided into two parties with regard to the
      origin of life. These parties were known as <i>animists</i> and <i>animalculists</i>.
      It was largely by the later researches of Highmore (1613-1685) upon the
      anatomy of the testis and the epididymis, supplemented by those of Aubrey
      in Florence concerning the ovaries (which had been previously considered
      as female testicles), and the researches of Stenon concerning the muscular
      nature of the uterus, that a better knowledge of reproduction was
      established. De Graaf (1641-1673), a physician of Delft, Holland, pointed
      out the ovarian follicles, known to-day under his name, while Swammerdam
      (1637-1686) studied the comparative anatomy of the ovaries,&mdash;and was,
      by the way, the first to prove that the queen bee is a female. Needham,
      the London anatomist and physician, and Hoboken, of Utrecht, described
      more accurately the placenta and the coverings of the ovum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anatomical discoveries crowded along about this time. For instance,
      Wharton (1610-1673) discovered the sub-maxillary duct, named after him;
      Glisson (1647-1671) studied the liver and recognized its capsule, that
      still bears his name; Nuck injected the lymphatics with quicksilver, and
      studied the glands especially; Stenson discovered the excretory duct of
      the parotid, and Rivinius (his name being translated in German, Bachmann)
      found the sublingual duct; Peyer, Schafhausen, and Brunner, the latter a
      professor in Heidelberg, discovered the intestinal glands which bear their
      names; Wirsung, of Bavaria (who was assassinated in 1643 by another
      physician), discovered in the dissecting-room of Vesalius, at Padua, the
      excretory duct of the pancreas; Pacchioni found the bodies named after him
      in the dura mater; Havers, of London, discovered the synovial glands and
      the so-called Haversian canals; Cowper, already mentioned, discovered the
      small glands named after<span class="pagenum">184</span><a name="link184"
      id="link184"></a> him, located in front of the prostate, and Bartholin yet
      other glands, in the labia, which bear his name; Mei-bom, professor in
      Helmstàdt, discovered the small glands in the eyelids which are named
      after him. Besides these, many other discoveries might be recorded here,
      did time permit. One other, however, deserves to be mentioned, with which
      the name of Schneider (1614-1680) must always be honorably connected. He
      described the mucous membrane of the nose and demonstrated anatomically
      and clinically that not the brain, but this membrane, secretes the mucous
      discharge during fluxes from the nose. This overthrew at once and forever
      the ancient doctrine, which included so many and various "catarrhal"
      diseases. I might add also that the best and most complete description of
      the<span class="pagenum">186</span><a name="link186" id="link186"></a>

     the bone of the right arm corrupted. VII represents the bone
     of the arm totally corrupted and sharp, which was pulled
     away with the pullers, but by pieces, without any noise or
     pain. VIII shows the place where the corrupt bone of the arm
     lay, which was now pulled forth, which Nature filled up with
     a callous, so that the patient could perform country
     business without any impediment. The patient was a
     countryman of Pappatavia, whose arm a souldier broke in four
     places, without any wound, anno 1636. IX is a fracture of

      By the middle and latter portions of the seventeenth century most of the
      better physicians and surgeons had either assumed offices and positions in
      which they were supported by the State, or were settled in permanent
      residences, which was not the case with the mass of physicians in the
      sixteenth century. As a result the reputation of the entire profession
      began to improve, while the unlimited license and absolute freedom of
      practice prevailing during the Middle Ages were almost entirely done away
      with. By this time the clerical element had disappeared almost entirely
      from medical circles, or only dabbled in certain specialties. The Thirty
      Years' War was fatal to the supremacy of the clergy in matters of public
      health. Moreover, the increase of international intercourse favored the
      communication of medical knowledge.

      The physicians of this period were more occupied with chemistry and
      physics than had ever been the case before. Nevertheless, this was also
      the special age of <i>alchemists</i> and of <i>impecuniosity</i>.
      According to one of the classifications of the time, the regular
      profession was supposed to include physicians, surgeons, barbers,
      regimental surgeons, lithotomists, bath-keepers, midwives, nurses,
      apothecaries, druggists, and even confectioners and grocers. Another list
      of impostors and quacks, equally official, was made to include old women,
      village priests, hermits, quacks,&mdash;

      after crystals), mountebanks, vagrants, magicians, exorcists, monsters,
      rat-catchers, jugglers, and gypsies. Veterinary physicians were also at
      that time included in this class.

      Anatomy was now studied more from human bodies, and was authorized by
      statute. This was especially the case in non-German institutions, to which
      for this reason students flocked in great numbers. In Dresden, so early as
      1617, there was a dissecting-room in which stuffed birds, at that time a
      great rarity, and similar curiosities were preserved. The study of anatomy
      was at a low ebb in Germany; so that when Rolfink, in 1629, arranged at
      Jena, which was then the most popular German university, for two public
      dissections upon executed malefactors, it was considered such an event
      that the very highest authorities were present. But the peasantry took
      such fright at this occurrence that for a long time afterward they watched
      their cemeteries by night lest the corpses should be dug up and, as they
      said, "Rolfinked." Vienna did not possess a skeleton until 1658.
      Strassburg obtained one of a male in 1671, and several years later one of
      a female. In Edinburgh an anatomical theatre was first erected in 1697 in
      Surgeons' Hall. It is worthy of remark that anatomical plates, designed to
      be lifted off in layers, existed even at this period. About the middle of
      this century there arose a dispute at the bedside of the Margrave of
      Baden, between two learned professors and the regular court physician,
      whether a plaster to be applied over the patient's heart should be placed
      in the middle of the chest, according to Galen, or upon the left side. The
      dispute was settled by opening, before the eyes of the noble patient, a
      hog, by means of which it was demonstrated that, as a matter of fact, the
      heart of the hog lay on the left side. So convinced was his excellency
      that he dismissed the ordinary physician, who had held a contrary opinion
      as to the position of a nobleman's heart.<span class="pagenum">188</span><a name="link188" id="link188"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The general barbarity and immorality of this century were conspicuous,
      especially among the upper classes, and by its close had spread from
      France, became naturalized in both Germany and Italy, and extended even to
      the universities,<span class="pagenum">189</span><a name="link189"
      id="link189"></a> their professors, and their students. The life of the
      latter during this period was more vulgar and rude than ever before, and
      almost more so than ever since. Pennalism&mdash;that is to say, barbarity
      toward junior students&mdash;became unbounded, so that outbreaks occurred
      even during lectures. At last the State authorities were compelled to
      interfere. Student outrages were very frequent and often fatal, and their
      outbursts were disgraceful in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in France was instruction in surgery well regulated, for this was the
      only country which possessed a proper surgical college. Practical
      instruction was imparted to mid wives&mdash;in Paris through a special
      institution, in Germany through the Midwives' Guild; the barbers, too,
      continued to receive instruction from their guilds; while instruction in
      pharmacy was given by the master-apothe-caries, too often dogmatically and
      even farcically, serving as objects for the keen satire of Molière. The
      expenses of graduation were very great, and the ceremonies sometimes
      lasted two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another way this same seventeenth century might be characterized as one
      of aggrandizement for physicians,&mdash;that is, as one during which their
      position was improved in the eyes of the public and better supported by
      the State. The physicians proper&mdash;the "<i>medici pitri</i>"&mdash;were
      still persons of the profoundest gravity, with fur-trained robes, perukes,
      canes, and swords, when matters were prosperous, who for their lives would
      do nothing more than write prescriptions in formal style, everything else
      being considered beneath their dignity,&mdash;even as they affect in
      England to*day. They demanded to be called in every case, however, even
      though they knew nothing about it, claiming that only by means of their
      presence could things certainly go right. Nevertheless, in dangerous cases&mdash;for
      example, during the plague&mdash;they left the surgeons alone, while they
      looked upon the sick through the windows. In spite of this, however, they
      were generally esteemed and often<span class="pagenum">190</span><a
      name="link190" id="link190"></a> sought for, as well in public as in
      private. Some of them were supplied with large libraries by their patrons
      or through their positions under the government, and most of them enjoyed
      moderate prosperity. Their pay was, for the most part, regulated in
      accordance with a definite tariff, while the State gradually cut down the
      doctor's honorarium to the pay of a day-laborer. During that century a
      certain physician to a countess in Munich received $25 as his annual
      stipend. For being present at a post-mortem and rendering an opinion
      thereon, each physician received $1.75. Surgeons who were zealous and
      eager were always highly esteemed; they were often better educated, in
      many respects, because of their extensive travels; but the social
      emancipation of the surgeons was not completed until the eighteenth
      century. About this time amputation of the arm was supposed to be worth 31
      marks ($7.75); of the leg, 41 marks; or, if a patient died, half this
      price. Lithotomy cost 51 marks, or half of that if the patient died. For
      cataract operation on one eye the surgeon received 17 marks; for a like
      operation on both eyes, 25 marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find in medicine, as in other branches of knowledge, that each
      succeeding century presents its added quota of imperishable facts, making
      it still more important than its predecessor. We may say that the
      fifteenth century had prepared the way for a reforming idealism which was
      the principal characteristic of the sixteenth; and that in the seventeenth
      century the realistic reaction against this same idealism showed itself in
      the church and the State by struggles against constituted authority, and
      in medical science by the domination of inductive philosophy. The idealism
      of the eighteenth century was not reformative and humanistic, but
      revolutionary and humanitarian. The unsettled character of the century's
      events may be charged, in some degree, to the American and French
      revolutions, with their interpretation (and their attempted attainment) of
      the<span class="pagenum">191</span><a name="link191" id="link191"></a>
      so-called "rights of man." The masses were now supposed to be released,
      and philosophers created new doctrines, which had a greater influence upon
      the times than ever had philosophical doctrines before. Rousseau, for
      instance, aroused a revolution in politics and education, while skeptics
      and materialists alike strove for general enlightenment, which was sadly
      needed. Among the higher classes extravagance and immorality prevailed
      extensively, among the lower classes poverty and ignorance. In Germany the
      rulers even sold their subjects, as when Hesse-Cassel sold to the English
      seventeen hundred mercenary soldiers, and other States sold smaller
      numbers. A criminal code, published in 1769, contained seventeen
      copper-plate engravings, illustrating various methods of torture. A
      physician was always present when torture was inflicted, to see that the
      victim's sufferings were not greater than he could bear. This inhuman mode
      of eliciting testimony was last practiced in Europe in 1869, in the Swiss
      Canton of Zug. Popular education was a myth, and the children of bondmen
      were not permitted to learn. No wonder the French revolution was hailed
      with joy along the Rhine, where it swept away at once and forever the
      petty rulers, abbots, and bishops, who were the "bloodsuckers" of the
      people. The numerous wars of the century had no great influence upon the
      development of medicine, except in the direction of surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eighteenth century was revolutionary also in the introduction of
      freedom of religious thought, so that clerical physicians disappeared
      entirely from the ranks, save a few who officiated as lithotomists, like
      Frère Come, or as oculists, like Wrabetz, the latter of whom was even a
      professor in Prague.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the century, too, of Leibnitz and Kant, of Linnæus and Lavoisier,
      as well as of Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, and Goethe. During it the most
      conspicuous services in nearly all branches of learning were rendered by
      the Germans,<span class="pagenum">192</span><a name="link192" id="link192"></a>
      instead of by the Italians and English, as during' the preceding century.
      In fact, Germany was then at the zenith of her glory, and supplied an
      impulse for all other nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of philosophy and the natural sciences became also more and
      more marked. At the head of its philosophers must be placed Leibnitz
      (164:6-1716), who, by his own writings and those of his pupils, created a
      philosophical school, whose influence is still every where felt. His
      doctrine was dualistic: Matter is created once for all, and has no further
      need of the Creator. As concerns the spiritual world, he assumed minute,
      indivisible, intelligent beings, called monads,&mdash;constituents of all
      bodies and all beings. In close relation with him stood Kant, while in
      England Locke and Hume became leaders of the opposed and materialistic
      school, declaring the brain to be an organ for the secretion of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the universities founded during the eighteenth century were those of
      Breslau, 1702; Bonn, 1771; Stuttgart, 1781; Pesth, 1794; Gottingen, 1737;
      and Erlangen, 1743. Medicine was also cultivated in learned societies,
      which increased constantly in numbers. In 1744 Frederick the Great united
      two other societies into his Royal Academy. In Switzerland, in 1751, was
      founded an association of physicians and naturalists, while in France
      royal scientific societies were founded at Bordeaux, Montpellier, Lyons,
      and Dijon, and the Royal Medical Society of Paris lived from 1717 until
      1788. In spite of all these opportunities for enlightenment, everything
      was not yet enlightened. Then de Haën defended the existence of demons,
      and Maerz, a well-known theological teacher, in 1760 devoted a book to
      witches and magic. That witches were burned publicly is a matter of
      history, even in America. So late as 1821 there was a statute regarding
      witches in Ireland, and they were burned in Mexico as recently as 1877.
      But these are flying pictures of the eighteenth century, which are meant<span

      moment to illustrate the more serious topic, to which we must now address

      First of all, the <i>medical systems and theories of the century</i>. Many
      hundred years previously Galen had originated a method, which deserves,
      perhaps, the title of pure eclecticism. The first purely eclectic system
      similar to his originated with Boerhaave (1688-1738), perhaps the most
      famous physician of his or any other century. He was the son of a
      clergyman near Leyden, Holland, and was one of thirteen children.
      Originally intended for the clerical profession, he had studied
      philosophy, history, logic, metaphysics, philology, mathematics, as well
      as theology, with great diligence. His education was, later, directed to
      the study of medicine, because of the statement that the purity of certain
      theological doctrines was endangered by him. So he studied chemistry and
      botany, and then anatomy and medicine,<span class="pagenum">194</span><a
      name="link194" id="link194"></a> graduating in 1693. He practiced in
      Leyden with great success, and was offered a court position. In 1709 he
      was tendered the chair of Medicine and Botany, and in 1714 that of the
      Practice of Medicine; in 1718 he was also made Professor of Chemistry. In
      all of these positions he displayed the greatest capacity. He was a
      clinical teacher of rare talent, and soon acquired such reputation as to
      attract to Leyden students from all parts of the world in such numbers
      that no lecture-room in the university could contain them. He was the
      first to give separate lectures on the subject of ophthalmology, and
      employed the magnifying-glass in examining the eye. As a practitioner he
      was no less popular, and he left an estate valued at two million dollars.
      He was so famous that, when a Chinese official addressed a letter "To the
      Most Famous Physician in Europe," it reached him safely. He made no
      distinction in his patients, and compelled Peter the Great to wait a whole
      night for his turn to consult him. His most eminent pupils were: Haller,
      Van Swieten, de Haën. Gaub, and Cullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boerhaave's influence and dignity, which were astonishing, even in a
      physician, were based no less upon his encyclopaedic attainments than upon
      the benevolence and purity of his character. He was free from
      disputatiousness and vanity, although everywhere regarded as an oracle.
      His universal maxim was: "Simplicity is the seal of truth," although he
      never manifested this in his therapeutics. He employed the thermometer in
      the axilla in examining his cases, as did the iatrophysicists of the
      previous century.
    </p>
    <p>
      His doctrines did not form a new system, but rather a composite of earlier
      systems, he stands also in the anomalous position of one who had the whole
      world at his feet, and yet contributed little or nothing which has been of
      essential importance. In fact, his peculiar views have been so universally
      given up that they are of only meagre historic interest. He looked upon
      disease as a condition in which<span class="pagenum">195</span><a
      name="link195" id="link195"></a> bodily action or natural activities,
      being disturbed or unsettled, could take place only with difficulty; the
      reverse of this, of course, constituted good health. Fever he regarded as
      an effort of Nature to ward off death. Digestion was explained, like the
      circulation, upon mechanical principles. In his therapeutics, besides his
      efforts to sweeten the acid, to purify the stomach, to get rid of
      acridities, he made Hippocrates and Sydenham his models. His biographers
      say that his medicines were less effective than his personal appearance.
      He left many adherents, but no school of followers. It must be said,
      however, to his credit, that, while not the first to give clinical
      instruction, he permanently established a clinical method in teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaub (1705-1780), professor in Leyden from 1731, was but little inferior
      to his master, Boerhaave, in fame as a teacher. He wrote the first
      complete work on the exclusive subject of general pathology. In general
      therapeutics he considered the healing power of Nature amply sufficient to
      remove sickness, but attributed this power sometimes to the soul and
      sometimes to the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      There arose, naturally, strenuous opposition to the views and teachings of
      Boerhaave, and his principal opponent was Stahl (1660-1734), who was one
      of the most important systematists of any age, a profound thinker, and a
      pioneer chemist. He began lecturing in Jena at once upon his graduation,
      at the age of twenty-five, and moved through two or three different
      university positions until he came to Berlin at the age of fifty-six. He
      was a great pietist, of uncouth manners, faithful to his laboriously
      acquired convictions, and bitter and relentless against those who could
      not accept them. Indeed, he regarded his convictions as revelations from
      God. He looked upon the success of another as a personal injury to
      himself, and from being first a croaker he became finally a confirmed
      misanthrope, until he fell into actual melancholia. Pecuniary profit he
      had never sought, and its pursuit he scorned.<span class="pagenum">196</span><a
      name="link196" id="link196"></a> His views were dynamico-organic,
      pietistic, and antagonistic. He regarded the soul as the supreme
      principle, life-giving and life-preserving, not to be confounded with the
      spirit; when hindered or obstructed in its operation, disease was present.
      The soul governed the organism chiefly by way of the circulation;
      consequently, plethora played an important rôle. To get rid of this
      plethora the soul employed either fever or convulsive movements; for
      example, in children plethora produces a pressure of blood to the head,
      and, by way of compensation, the soul provides a haemorrhage from the
      nose. For reasons easily appreciated, he regarded bleeding piles as
      safety-valves of the utmost importance. Fever was a salutary effort of the
      soul to preserve the body; this was true even of intermittents, and,
      accordingly, he never gave cinchona. He scorned anatomy and physiology,
      saying, in one place, that medicine had profited as much by the knowledge
      of the bones in the ear as by a knowledge of snow which had fallen ten
      years previously. But Stahl was one of the most eminent chemists of the
      age, and did a great deal to liberate chemistry from the glamour of
      alchemy and the domination of pharmacy, and to transform it into an
      independent science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stahl's doctrine has been called <i>animism</i>, and was a reaction
      against the chemical and mechanical theories of the seventeenth century.
      He gained a considerable number of followers, the most notable of them
      among the French being Sauvages (1706-1767), the forerunner of Pinel and
      an opponent of pure mechanics, who animated the mechanical system of the
      body with Stahl's "soul." This was, par excellence, the age of artificial
      systems, and so Sauvages in his classification supplied a system which had
      ten classes of diseases, each of which had several orders, and some as
      many as two hundred and ninety-five genera, and two thousand four hundred
      species of disease!! Even Linnæus had three hundred and twenty-five genera
      of disease,<span class="pagenum">197</span><a name="link197" id="link197"></a>
      while Cullen had only four classes with one hundred and forty-nine genera.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanico-dynamic system was a sort of compromise or mixed system,
      which was held in high honor by the most eminent physicians and better
      minds of the last century, and has even been prized by Sprengel as the
      best of all. It was originated by Friedrich Hoffmann (1660-1742).
      Hoffmann's father was a physician, and he was himself born in Halle, whose
      university he attended. He acquired lasting reputation as an oculist, and
      was made Professor of Anatomy, Surgery, Medicine, Physics, and Chemistry
      at his <i>alma mater</i>. Our commonplace "Hoffmann's anodyne" is named
      after him. He was one of the most erudite professors of his day, more
      easily understood than Stahl, widely known for his fluent diction and
      amiable temper, and, accordingly, won great renown for his university. His
      good fortune as a practitioner was so great that even Boerhaave declared
      him his own equal. As a writer he was voluminous, one edition of his works
      comprising twenty-seven large volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Hoffmann's views, life was simply mechanical movement,
      especially of the heart; death, the cessation of heart-action,
      putrefaction thereupon resulting. Health meant regularity of movements;
      disease, a disturbance of the same. He used the word "tonus" extensively.
      Ether he regarded as an important factor, producing and maintaining
      movements of the body, itself extremely volatile, corresponding largely to
      the "pneuma" of the ancients; it was, in fact, a motor principle and, at
      the same time, the perceptive soul. Ether was stored in the medulla, and
      circulated in a double way in the body; spasm was the consequence of too
      strong, atony of too feeble, influx of ether. Fever was a general spasm of
      the arteries and veins, having its cause in the spinal cord. Hoffmann's
      therapeutics were simple, and poor in drugs. These latter were intended to
      weaken, alter, or evacuate, and he<span class="pagenum">198</span><a
      name="link198" id="link198"></a> was especially partial to the use of
      vinous remedies. The strong and toxic drugs he used but little.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Cullen (1712-1790), a Scotchman, rose from the deepest poverty to
      the greatest celebrity. First a barber, he afterward became an apothecary,
      then a ship-surgeon, then a village practitioner, finally entering into
      partnership with William Hunter as a general practitioner. Both of these
      eminent men being in equally poor circumstances, they agreed to live in
      the same place and that, while one was studying, the other should take
      care of the practice. In this way Cullen was enabled to graduate in 1740.
      Six years later he taught chemistry in Glasgow, and in ten years more came
      to Edinburgh as Professor of Medicine. He continued very active and famous
      up to the time of his death, but died as he had been born,&mdash;in
      poverty. Among his numerous other charitable deeds, he supported the widow
      of Robert Burns and published the latter's poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cullen was the father of modern Solidism,&mdash;a system based upon the
      solid parts of the body, the nerves being the chief agents. The
      life-giving element was, in his view, an undefined, dynamic something
      (different from Hoffmann's ether or Stahl's soul), which he called <i>nerve-force,
      or nerve-principle; animal force; and brain-energy</i>, and in it he
      included the spinal cord. His nerve-principle was supposed to produce
      spasms and atony, either actively or passively. The causes of disease,
      while of a debilitating character, were supposed to awaken reaction of the
      healing powers of Nature; fever was a reparative effort of Nature, even in
      its cold stage, the blood playing no part in it. He constructed a very
      arbitrary classification of fevers, as, in fact, he did of all diseases,
      his system of nosology being the secret of his reputation. His explanation
      of gout was famous. That disorder, he said, depended upon an atony in the
      digestive organs against which was periodically set up a reparative effort
      in form of a<span class="pagenum">199</span><a name="link199" id="link199"></a>
      joint inflammation. In scrofula he had to assume, in contradiction to his
      nervous pathology, a peculiar acridity, and in putrid fever a putridity of
      the humors of the body. His therapeutics were simple and salutary, because
      of his renunciation of venesection, which was much abused in his day.
    </p>

      The most celebrated pupils and successors of Hoffmann were Gregory, of
      Edinburgh, Gardiner, and, in Germany, the famous Thaer (1752-1828), who
      finally abandoned the practice of medicine because it promised more than
      it could perform, and who became a "father of husbandry."

      A composite of the doctrine of Hippocrates, Sydenham, and Boerhaave was
      represented in the so-called Old Vienna School, whose connection with the
      lives of Maria Theresa and Joseph II deserves, at least, mention. Its
      founder was Baron Van Swieten (1700-1772), of Leyden, a descendant of a
      noble Jansenist family of the Netherlands, who graduated under Boerhaave
      after having studied at Louvain. After the death of his patron he was
      called to the assistance of the Archduchess Maria Anna, of Austria, who
      was suffering from an abortion, and gave such satisfaction that she
      recommended him to her sister, Maria Theresa, who up to this time had
      remained sterile. To her and to her husband he gave advice which resulted
      in sixteen successive pregnancies, and then, as the result of his success,
      came to Vienna in 1745 as President of the General Medical Department of
      Austria. He was also made censor, in which position he incurred the enmity
      especially of the Jesuits and of Voltaire, whom he robbed of their
      influence. He was made baron, and became, next to Kaunitz, the most
      influential counselor of the empress. His chief care was dedicated to the
      elevation of medical affairs in Austria, and especially to the improvement
      of the medical faculty. He had just seen success crown his efforts when he
      died of senile gangrene, with the reputation of being a great physician
      and benefactor of the poor. One of the greatest of his<span class="pagenum">200</span><a
      name="link200" id="link200"></a> services was improving the treatment of
      syphilis, in which he, after the example of Paracelsus, recommended the
      internal use of corrosive sublimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      More eminent as a physician than for personal character was de Haën
      (1704-1776), of The Hague,&mdash;a pupil of Boerhaave. At the suggestion
      of Van Swieten, he was called, in 1754, to Vienna as president of the
      clinic of the city hospital, which at that time afforded accommodation for
      only twelve patients. He was the real founder of the so-called Old Vienna
      School, whose merit, in contrast to the so-called new school, is to be
      sought in practical and diagnostic services. As de Haën quarreled with
      every one, he also did with Stoerck (1749-1803), the successor of Van
      Swieten in the direction of the Austrian Medical Department, and with
      Stoll (1742-1787),&mdash;a clinical teacher who was especially famous as
      an epidemiologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoll lectured with great popularity until 1784, upon the completion of
      the Allgemeines Krankenhaus, when he fell into the background and was
      badly treated. He was the subject of numerous intrigues by his enemies,
      and had a wife who embittered his life, and who even had him buried in the
      dress of a Jesuit in order to injure his reputation after his death. To
      his credit be it said that, changing his views of the constituents of
      disease later in life and his original therapeutics becoming no longer of
      use to him, he abandoned them entirely. Nevertheless his therapeutic
      system flourished for a long time after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were in vogue during this period numerous other doctrines, some of
      which were too puerile or insubstantial to gain any foothold at all;
      others exerted a certain amount of influence during the life-time of their
      originators or for a generation afterward. With many of these I do not
      care in any way to deal. A few others, I think, ought to be at least
      mentioned in such a history as I am endeavoring to present.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another Hoffmann&mdash;Christopher Ludwig
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoffmann<span class="pagenum">201</span><a name="link201" id="link201"></a>
      (1721-1807), of Westphalia, who devised a so-called humoral theory in
      which the "acridities" of Boer-haave were mingled with the "putridities"
      of the pneu-matists and the "irritability" of Glisson. His treatment and
      remedies for diseases were supposed to be antiseptic, as was very proper
      when dealing with putridities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory known as the "Doctrine of Infarctus" had its origin with Kampf,
      who died in 1753. By infarctus Kampf understood impacted fæces, which he
      thought originated in the humors of the body, portal vessels, and
      intestines; he recognized two kinds,&mdash;the black bilious and the
      mucous. From this theory a wide-spread clyster fashion developed, and
      lords and ladies vied with each other in belaboring their infarcti and in
      administering enemas. As Baas says: "We cannot deny to the author of this
      doctrine at least an extensive knowledge of human nature. He supplied a
      universal remedial procedure, and gratified the apothecaries with the
      bulkiness of the herbs required for its practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite antagonistic to the views of the Vienna School were those of the
      School of Montpellier, inaugurated by Bordeu (1732-1796), and generally
      known as <i>vitalism</i>. Bordeu died in the enjoyment of great
      reputation, but at variance with all his colleagues. He maintained the
      existence of a general life of the body,&mdash;a composite life,&mdash;resulting
      from the harmonious working of the individual lives and powers of all the
      organs, which were supposed to be associated with each other, but each for
      its own definite function; the most important organs&mdash;the stomach,
      heart, and brain&mdash;being called "the tripod of life." In pathology he
      laid great weight upon crises, which were supposed to proceed from the
      glands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important representative of vitalism was Barthez (1734-1806), of
      Montpellier,&mdash;a man of great gifts and eager for knowledge. He
      recognized a vital principle as the cause of the phenomena of life, but
      acknowledged that<span class="pagenum">202</span><a name="link202"
      id="link202"></a> its nature was unknown, although he endowed it with
      motion and sensibility different from a thinking mind.. Plants were
      supposed to possess it likewise. Disease, he believed, was the result of
      an affection of this vital principle. Every disease was divisible into
      certain disease-elements, viewed as parts of the whole, and these were
      again divisible into secondary elements. He explained putrid fevers as
      specific vital diseases,&mdash;in which view, of course, he embodied
      humoral ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Germany, at about this time, a similar doctrine obtained,&mdash;a
      doctrine of vital forces,&mdash;which the versatile Reil (1759-1813)
      elaborated into a system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, in England, a doctrine was elaborated by Erasmus Darwin
      (1731-1802) which partook, in a certain degree, of the doctrines of Stahl,
      Hoffmann, Haller, Brown, and Bordeu. Erasmus Darwin distinguished himself,
      not only as a physician, but as a poet, philosopher, and physiologist. He
      was a friend of James Watt. Of his life it is said that by his practice
      and very fortunate marriages he became wealthy, ate much, and drank
      nothing but water. His chief work&mdash;entitled <i>Zoonomia, or the Laws
      of Organic Life</i>&mdash;was published in 1784, and is well worthy of
      perusal to-day. He recognized two fundamental substances&mdash;spirit and
      matter. But it is not so much for his doctrine as for his researches into
      animal and plant physiology, and, reflexly, because of his more celebrated
      descendant of the same name, that we owe him most gratitude.

      class="pagenum">203</span><a name="link203" id="link203"></a> the
      eighteenth century also arose the illusory doctrine of Animal Magnetism,
      which obtained among all classes a following that can be accounted for
      only by the attractiveness of the marvelous and unexplained. Frank Mesmer,
      born near Lake Constance, in 1754, was early a victim of romantic
      yearnings, and his graduating thesis, delivered in Vienna, dealt with the
      influence of the planets upon man and the use of the magnet. After
      traveling extensively he erected a private institution, where he treated
      blind girls, fidgety old maids, and simpletons, until his deceptive
      methods were unmasked by a commission appointed by the Empress Maria
      Theresa, and he was compelled to leave Vienna in twenty-four hours. This
      martyrdom recommended him in Paris, where the so-called Mesmerism speedily
      became fashionable. He finally undertook instructions in magnetizing, at
      the rate of 100 louis a head, and founded the "Order of Harmony." His
      so-called <i>baquets</i> were tubs with magnetic ducts, partially filled
      with soft water and all kinds of ingredients, and armed with iron
      conductors, with which his pupils, joining hands, placed themselves in
      contact. At these <i>séances</i> Mesmer appeared in lilac-colored clothes
      and professed to reinforce the action of the tubs by looks, gestures,
      playing upon the harmonica, and touching the subjects with wand or
      fingers. "If any one,<span class="pagenum">204</span><a name="link204"
      id="link204"></a> particularly a lady, had a crisis at this time, she was
      borne to the 'crisis-chamber' by Mesmer himself, where he treated her
      alone, as only when alone, he claimed, could he attain success." He
      speedily became wealthy; managed to deceive even the Queen of France; and,
      when he threatened to deprive the country of his presence, 20,000 francs
      were offered him to instruct others in his art. This offer, however, the
      wily charlatan declined. In 1785 some fool penned an article extolling him
      as a worker of miracles; this stimulated the authorities to organize a
      committee of investigation, the adverse decision of which, along with some
      contributory evidence, made Paris too warm for him. After the revolution
      he returned, but his day had passed, and he figures no more in medical
      history. He has had many imitators, and the mesmeric craze, at times, has
      infested different portions of the civilized globe; even some who were
      eminent in science have fallen into the snares of so-called Mesmerism,&mdash;notably
      Olbers, the discoverer of a number of asteroids. Mystic medical doctrines,
      founded upon Mesmer's views, still continue in certain circles, though the
      majority have long since succumbed to the advances of scientific
      psychology. In this connection it is proper to speak of the revived
      interest in "animal magnetism" due to the researches of Dr. James Braid,
      of Manchester, England. This gentleman, in 1842, published a work which
      pretty thoroughly exposed the fallacies of the doctrine of Mesmer, and
      expounded many of the truths that were entangled therein. He was among the
      first, perhaps, to employ the phrase "animal magnetism," and was the
      author of the term "hypnotism," though in his day the popular title was <i>Braidism</i>.<span

      During the middle of the eighteenth century arose a doctrine that, in its
      novelty, ease of practical application, and apparent consistency (through
      the ingenious employment of certain vital phenomena), secured such a hold
      that its influence continued even into the present century. This was the
      "Brunonian doctrine," promulgated and upheld by the great foe and rival of
      Cullen,&mdash;Doctor John Brown. In youth very precocious, though of most
      humble birth, Doctor Brown had mastered the Latin language at the early
      age of seven years, and three years later essayed to learn a trade. At the
      age of twenty he left his native village of Dunse for Edinburgh, seeking
      employment as a tutor and intending to study theology. Poverty soon
      compelled him, however, to take a rural school, but he returned a few
      years later (in 1759) to the Scottish Athens and began the study of
      medicine, supporting himself meantime by rendering theses into Latin and
      by teaching, translating, and quizzing. Finally, he attracted the
      attention of Cullen, to whom he became useful through his knowledge of the
      classics; but, ultimately, a foolish quarrel made bitter enemies of the
      former friends. In 1770, in private lectures, Brown<span class="pagenum">206</span><a
      name="link206" id="link206"></a> began to advance the theory to which he
      had been led by one of his own attacks of gout that disappeared under the
      use of stimulants, the disease having previously always been aggravated by
      the treatment prescribed and that was held to be orthodox,&mdash;viz.,
      antiphlogistic. He had now become somewhat dissolute, and the students he
      gathered about him were of very much the same character; but they formed
      the nidus of a great following opposed to Cullen, and quarreled on all
      occasions with the adherents of the latter. Finally, Doctor Brown removed
      to London, where fortune seemed to smile upon him, as he gained rapidly in
      reputation and practice; indeed, he barely missed a call to Berlin and
      another to Padua as a teacher, the scale being turned against him by his
      dissolute habits. Though possessed of the highest mental gifts, Brown was
      unfortunate in lack of mental stamina. He taught that life is not a
      natural condition, but an artificial and necessary result of constant
      irritations; all living beings, therefore, tend toward death. Health is an
      intermediate grade of excitement; diseases, which are either sthenic or
      asthenic, represent either too high or too low a grade of excitement. It
      has been said that Brown's teachings slaughtered more human beings than
      the French Révolution and the wars of Napoleon combined. In England this
      system found no important followers, but in America Benjamin Rush, of
      Philadelphia (1745-1815), distinguished himself as an adherent. In Spain
      and France it found little place; but in Italy, and later in Germany, it
      secured a numerous and important following, which numbered, among others,
      Scarpa, Massini, and Girtanner. <span class="pagenum">207</span><a

      Another system which attained influential development, extending even into
      the present century, was the so-called <i>Realism</i>, originated by Pin
      el (1745-1836). Born in poverty, and designed for the Roman Catholic
      Church, Pinel did not turn his attention to medicine until his thirtieth
      year, but on completing his studies he rapidly rose to positions of
      importance. Led to the investigation of mental diseases by the fate of one
      of his particular friends, who had become insane, escaped into the forest,
      and was there devoured by wolves, Pinel speedily developed a great
      interest in this class of sufferers. The lot of the insane at this time
      was most pitiable: they were imprisoned, chained, and treated worse than
      wild beasts. In his efforts to improve their lot, Pinel acquired the title
      of conservative and aristocrat, either of which was almost equivalent to a
      death-sentence. Unterrified, however, he appeared before the Paris Council
      and urged the adoption of reformatory measures, replying to the challenges
      of skeptical and selfregardful opponents by liberating a number of insane
      patients who were in his charge. The courage thus exhibited receives
      appreciation in our time, if never before. Not the least<span
      class="pagenum">208</span><a name="link208" id="link208"></a> of Pinel's
      services was the substitution of analytical for synthetical methods; he
      also sought to determine disease by a diagnosis carefully constructed from
      symptoms, but unfortunately he made pathology and anatomy subordinate
      factors. He was a pupil of Barthez, but he placed his preceptor's vitalism
      far in the background.

      Francois Bichat, born in 1771, earned high rank both as a clinician and an
      anatomist. His education was begun in Nantes, but he studied surgery and
      anatomy in Lyons and Montpellier, subsequently going to Paris, where he
      became a member of Desault's family. After the death of his patron he
      lectured on surgery, and from 1797 on anatomy. Possessed of a feverish
      scientific activity, he became a member of the Société d'Emulation. Death
      overtook him in 1802 as the sequel of consumption and an injury received
      through a fall. He was the most capable physician of France in his time,
      and, brief as w>as his span of life, he was author of nine important
      volumes, the chief of which were a <i>Treatise on Membranes</i> and works
      on general and pathological anatomy. From the latter a new tendency in
      study took origin. He it was who gave utterance to the aphorism: "Take
      away some fevers and nervous troubles, and all else falls to the kingdom
      of pathological anatomy." As an evidence of his energy, it is related that
      he in one winter examined seven hundred bodies. He taught how to
      discriminate between disease processes, and notably subdivided
      peripneumonia into pleurisy, pneumonia, and bronchitis, these having been
      previously confounded. He once remarked: "You may observe disease of the
      heart, lungs, abdominal viscera, etc., night and morning by the sick-bed
      for twenty years, yet the whole furnishes merely a jumble of phenomena
      which unite in nothing complete; but if you open a few bodies, you will
      see the obscurity speedily give way,&mdash;a result never accomplished by
      observation if we do not know the seat of the disease." To Bichat is also
      due our modern recognition of cellular,<span class="pagenum">209</span><a
      name="link209" id="link209"></a> osseous, fibrous, and other tissues, as
      such, wherever they appear throughout the body. He differentiated, without
      the aid of the microscope, twenty-one different tissues as simple and
      similar elements of the body, enumerating them as one does the chemical
      elements; he described the stomach as composed of mucous, serous, and
      muscular layers; overthrew the speculative tendency of medicine, and
      placed facts in the front rank; and so conspicuous were his services that
      he has been termed the "Napoleon of Medicine." He supplemented the
      influence of Pinel upon the side of pathological anatomy; called
      sensibility and contractility vital properties, whose alterations
      constitute disease, claiming, however, that the vital properties of
      individual tissues differed among themselves. His life and works are
      revelations to young men and show what can be accomplished at a very early
      age<span class="pagenum">210</span><a name="link210" id="link210"></a> by
      sufficiently active and harmoniously developed brains.

      In reviewing the theories and lives of those mentioned as medical
      luminaries of the eighteenth century, one experiences a feeling of mingled
      respect and disappointment&mdash;respect for the devoted way in which they
      worked and sought for the truth, and disappointment at so much waste of
      intellectual power and labor. The lesson is also taught, and should be
      impressed, that in all so-called new systems old principles for the most
      part reappear, and that the labors of the past are rarely so deliberately
      consulted as to guard against repetition and revamping of theories that
      had long before been proved futile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me now mention a few other of the physicians of the last century who
      have left more or less of an impress upon their successors and upon our
      science. One man, in particular, historians are wont to remember with the
      honor that was denied him by his colleagues and contemporaries. I refer to
      Leopold Avenbrugger, who was born in Graz in 1722, and who, after pursuing
      his philosophical and professional studies in his native city, obtained,
      at the age of twenty-nine, charge of a Spanish military hospital; while
      thus employed lie invented the art of percussion as applied to diagnosis.
      This he gave the test of experience during seven long years before making
      it known to the profession, and even then it was not appreciated, but
      remained practically unnoticed until after his death, which occurred in
      1809. He did receive a patent of nobility from the Emperor Joseph II, but
      this hardly compensated him for the contumely heaped upon him by his
      colleagues. Paulus Ægineta employed sounds and specula; Santoro used the
      balance, counted the pulse, and resorted to the use of the thermometer;
      Boerhaave employed the thermometer and the simple lens; Floyer, and after
      him Haller, utilized the watch in marking seconds; a Salernian
      practitioner utilized auscultation and percussion in tympanites and
      ascites; but the<span class="pagenum">211</span><a name="link211"
      id="link211"></a> diagnosis of diseases of the great viscera by percussion
      was never known before Avenbrugger. His booklet of twenty-two pages,
      unsalable in his time, is to-day held worth far more than its weight in
      gold. His famous colleague, de Haën, wrote fifteen volumes without a word
      on percussion; Van Swieten did it no greater justice; in his great
      treatise the <i>History of Medicine</i>, Sprengel barely alludes to it;
      yet the contents of Avenbrugger's booklet were of more practical value
      than all that these other men ever wrote, or all the results of the vast
      and bloody campaigns during which it slept. In 1808 this volume was
      rescued from oblivion by Corvisart, who translated it into French and
      proclaimed its undying value.

      During the earlier part of this century lived Werlhof, of Helmstâdt
      (1699-1767), a far-famed observer, author, and practitioner, who declined
      a professorship, and especially distinguished himself as a writer of
      German poetry. Though possessed of an exceptional knowledge of modern
      tongues, he wrote only in Latin,&mdash;the scientific language of the day.
      In 1734 he was appointed physician to King George II, in which position he
      attained world-wide fame, while indefatigable in his efforts to elevate
      science. He first described the disease known by his name,&mdash;<i>morbus
      maculosus Werlhofii</i>,&mdash;and struggled hard to establish in Germany
      the use of cinchona.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1740 to 1802 flourished Wichman, of Hanover, highly esteemed as a
      writer and practitioner. He is especially known for his pleas in favor of
      more scientific diagnosés, and his demonstration of how to make them. The
      rôle of the itch-mite in the transmission of scabies he demonstrated upon
      himself; to be sure, Bonomo, a hundred years before, had called attention
      thereto, but with little avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another eminent Hanoverian was the fickle, stubborn, and misanthropic
      Zimmerman, born in 1728, in Berne, upon whom misfortune and disease played
      many shabby tricks.<span class="pagenum">212</span><a name="link212"
      id="link212"></a> He was, however, a man of ingenious endowments, and
      merits especial regard, because he sought to free medical science from the
      charge of being a secret art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of the prodigies of medical history was J. P. Frank, born (1725)
      in the Bavarian Palatinate, of pauper parents, and, while an infant,
      abandoned by a cruel father. His early life was passed in a religious
      school; at twenty-five he became a court and garrison physician, and later
      a professor in Gottingen; finally he went to Vienna, where he died in
      1801. He was greatly beloved by his pupils, and Walther, the famous
      surgeon, said of him: "No one ever made so elevating and permanent an
      impression on me." He published an extensive work on forensic medicine and
      sanitation,&mdash;wherein he took up the hygiene of the individual, of the
      family, and of the school,&mdash;which constituted an effort far ahead of
      anything of the kind previously known. He is also memorable for efforts
      toward increasing the population, for the Thirty Years' War had
      depopulated extensive districts&mdash;to such a degree, indeed that in
      1750 bigamy was legalized in Nuremberg and many other towns. Frank was
      distinguished for a keen and even caustic humor, whose subject was not
      infrequently himself.

      From 1707 to 1782 there lived in England one Sir John Pringle, chief of
      the Army Medical Department, known to this day as an author upon military
      hygiene. John Huxliam (1794-1868) advanced our knowledge of putrid
      dissolution of the blood. John Howard (1766-1790) rendered eminent service
      in prison reform. Heberden (1710-1801) was the first to describe
      varicella, and also angina pectoris&mdash;which was long known as
      Heberden's asthma. John Fothergil (1712-1780), a Quaker, acquired fame by
      his observations on chronic angina, neuralgia, and hydrocephalus; was
      likewise a benefactor of the poor, regarding them as "bridges to the
      pockets of the rich"; indeed, a large part of what he gained from the
      latter class<span class="pagenum">213</span><a name="link213" id="link213"></a>
      he bestowed in charity, and at his death left £200,000 for the same
      purpose. Radcliffe (1750-1814) was an eminent, witty, successful
      practitioner of London, who was wont to declare that, as a young
      practitioner, he possessed twenty remedies for every disease, but at the
      close of his career had found twenty diseases for which he had not one
      remedy. Richard Mead (1673-1754) was a prolific writer, and the author of
      the first quarantine regulations adopted in England. Contemporary with
      Mead was Lettsom,&mdash;the busiest, most philanthropic, and most
      successful physician of his day,&mdash;whose practice, although a large
      part of it was gratuitous, brought him sixty thousand dollars a year, and
      who gave away immense sums for charitable purposes; also, Thomas Dover,
      who invented the sedative known by his name and who died in 1741.
      Akenside, physician and poet (1721-1770), wrote on dysentery. Baillie, of
      Edinburgh, was the first to accurately describe the morbid anatomy of
      gastric ulcer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the French surgeons must be mentioned la Peyronie, of Montpellier,
      born in 1668, who ultimately became director of the Academy of Surgery and
      surgeon to the king. His wealth was employed for the elevation of the
      craft, and he founded no less than ten different surgical professorships
      at his own expense. In 1743 he effected the separation of the surgeons
      from the barbers. He died in 1747, dedicating his estate to the purpose
      for which he had lived. The most famous of the earlier surgeons of this
      century was J. L. Petit (16741750), inventor of the screw tourniquet, and
      who was called to treat Augustus the Strong, of Poland; indeed, several
      other crowned heads became his patients. Garen-geot (1688-1759), a
      professor in the College of St. Come, published a work on operative
      surgery. Morand (1697-1773) and le Dran were distinguished surgeons of
      Paris, the former especially noted for the number of times<span
      class="pagenum">214</span><a name="link214" id="link214"></a> he performed
      paracentesis. Famous lithotomists were le Cat and Frère Come,&mdash;whose
      real name was Baseilhac, and who operated by means of the lithotome caché,
      Astruc (1685-1766) was a syphilographer of extensive attainments; Quesnay
      (1694-1774), an eminent and undaunted surgeon of Louis XV, who wrote on
      the history and progress of surgery in France; Brasdor (1721-1776) was
      best known for his method of distal ligation in aneurism; Sabatier
      (1732-1811) wrote a famous treatise on operations, in which he recommended
      resection of the head of the humerus.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most celebrated surgeons was P, J. Desault (1744-1795), the son
      of a poor farmer, originally designed for the priesthood, but who, after
      obtaining a thorough mathematical education, began the study of surgery
      with an ignorant master of his native town. Subsequently he went to Paris,
      and here supported himself by teaching, gradually rising, step by step,
      until, without collegiate education, he became professor and chief-surgeon
      at the Hôtel-Dieu, where he established the first surgical clinic. He
      opposed violently the prevalent abuse of the trephine, and was also a
      champion of healing by first intention. A trusted friend of Desault was
      Ghopart, well known because of the amputation of the foot that bears his
      name. Another well-known surgeon, likewise a friend of Desault, was
      Doublet; and it is somewhat remarkable that Desault, Ghopart, and Doublet
      suffered persecution and perhaps martyrdom in connection with the supposed
      death of the Dauphin of France,&mdash;properly Louis XVII,&mdash;in 1795.
      There is evidence that the child who died in the temple was not the
      dauphin, but a substitute, and these three surgeons, who examined the
      corpse, had the hardihood to express their doubts. The same day that
      Desault reported upon the evidence he was invited to dinner by some
      members of the Convention, was taken ill at the table, and died almost
      immediately after his return home, A few days<span class="pagenum">215</span><a
      name="link215" id="link215"></a> later Chopart and Doublet died, also
      under mysterious circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daviel (1796-1862) is remembered among French surgeons chiefly for
      extraction of the lens as an independent method of treating cataract;
      Tenon (172-4-1816), for his writings on the anatomy and diseases of the
      eye; and Anel for originating the operation for aneurism, mistakenly
      attributed to Hunter. There were also many others, of lesser note, who
      distinguished themselves through special services to surgery or some of
      its branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Italians of this century may be mentioned Scarpa (1772-1832), of
      Motta, professor successively in Modena and Pavia, and who advanced our
      knowledge of hernia, diseases of the eyes, aneurism, and general anatomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most famous Spanish surgeon was Gimbernat, of Madrid (1742-1790), for
      a time professor in Barcelona, who also became distinguished through
      anatomical researches.
    </p>
    <p>
      German surgeons did not rank high during the earlier half of the last
      century, owing to the contempt engendered by the church for this branch of
      the medical art. The fashion of imitating the French, however, led to some
      surgical development. The first German surgeon of scientific education was
      Heister (1683-1758), of Frankfort-on-the-Main, who, unable to obtain
      honorable employment in the military service of his own country, entered
      that of Holland, where he remained until the experience of his own nation
      had brought about a healthy reaction. In 1720 he came to Helmstâdt, where
      he developed great activity in anatomy, surgery, and botany; also
      distinguished himself as a dentist and oculist, and discussed the whole
      range of surgical topics from the least to the greatest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bilguer (1720-1796), of Chur, became surgeon-general in Berlin, and
      performed the first resection of the wrist in 1762;<span class="pagenum">216</span><a
      name="link216" id="link216"></a> he was an opponent of amputation, which
      at that time was altogether too frequently practiced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Siebold (1736-1807) was the founder of an institution for surgical
      instruction, where, for the first time in Germany, surgery was taught
      clinically. He became one of the most famous teachers, and was first in
      his native land to perform the operation of symphysiotomy, so recently
      revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest German surgeon of the eighteenth century, however,&mdash;one
      eminent both as writer and operator,&mdash;was August Gottlieb Richter
      (1742-1812), of Zorbig, a descendant of a ministerial family, who wrote a
      famous work on hernia, and greatly improved all branches of surgery; he it
      was that enunciated the principle of dressing wounds "quickly, easily, and
      rarely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among English surgeons of the century must be mentioned, first of all,
      Cheselden (1688-1752). wrhose name is inseparably connected with anatomy
      and pathology as well as surgery At first a warm advocate of the high
      operation for stone, his dexterity in lithotomy excited the wonder of his
      contemporaries. He published a treatise on anatomy, and one on the
      suprapubic section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Monro, Sr. (1697-1767), of Edinburgh, was also eminent in both
      anatomy and surgery, and contributed more than any other one man to the
      success and reputation of the Scottish medical school. His sons, Alexander
      and Donald, and his grandson, Alexander (3d), w'ere equally celebrated in
      anatomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles White, of Manchester, is generally credited with having performed,
      in 1768, the first subperiosteal resection of the head of the humerus,
      although, as a matter of fact, this was not done until 1774, and then by
      Bent, of Newcastle. He also performed resection of the hip-joint upon the
      cadaver&mdash;another of the same name, Anthony White, having done the
      operation on the living subject in 1721. He invented the method of
      reducing dislocation of the<span class="pagenum">217</span><a
      name="link217" id="link217"></a> humerus with the foot in the axilla,&mdash;a
      procedure that is ordinarily ascribed to Sir Astley Cooper; also
      operations for false joint by the removal of the involved surfaces of the
      bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen that the excision of the joints was peculiarly an English
      method, the elbow-joint having been first excised in 1758, by Wainman, and
      the knee-joint by Filkin, of Northwich. The man who permanently attracted
      the attention of surgeons to these new operations was Henry Park, a bold
      surgeon, who wrote in 1782. The merits of these methods were then soon
      forgotten, however, and were revived in the present century by Liston and
      Syme.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the best-known London surgeons was Percival Pott (1749-1787), who
      became especially eminent through his<span class="pagenum">218</span><a
      name="link218" id="link218"></a> studies upon hernia, spinal disease, and
      diseases of the bones and joints; his complete chirurgical works appeared
      in London in 1771.

      William Hunter (1718-1783), of Scotch parentage, originally a theological
      student, and a pupil of Cullen, went to London in 1741, began to lecture
      on anatomy and surgery in 1746, and soon acquired a great reputation as a
      surgeon, obstetrician, and anatomist. He achieved enormous success in
      practice, and spent £100,000 upon his house, library, and private
      collections. The latter now form the Hunterian Museum in the University of
      Glasgow. His magnificent plates illustrating the gravid uterus required
      the labors of twenty years and appeared in 1774.<span class="pagenum">219</span><a

      John Hunter (1728-1793), younger brother of William, enjoyed even greater
      reputation than the latter. He was a pupil not only of his brother, but
      also of Cheselden and Pott. Beginning the practice of surgery in 1763, he
      became surgeon to St. George's Hospital in 1768, and Surgeon-general of
      the English forces in 1790. So memorable were the labors and services of
      this man that at the Royal College of Surgeons, of London, there is given
      annually an "Hunterian Oration," intended in some way to commemorate his
      labors or to draw some lesson from his life and work, To do justice to
      John Hunter would require a volume, hence we must at present dismiss the
      subject with this brief reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost equally famous as a surgeon, though by no means such an omnivorous
      student as Hunter, was Benjamin Bell, of Edinburgh, who died in 1806. He
      employed tubes of lead and silver for the purpose of drainage. Sir Charles
      and John Bell, also of Edinburgh, are eminent names pertaining to the
      latter part of the eighteenth and first part of the nineteenth century.
      The latter was Professor of Anatomy, Surgery, and Obstetrics, a busy
      practitioner, a fertile writer, and not only one of the most successful
      operators of his day, but an excellent classical scholar; his <i>Principles
      of Surgery</i> appeared from 1801 to 1807. Sir Charles, who died in 1842,
      belongs more to the present century, but was equally distinguished as an
      operator, surgeon, and writer, and best known, perhaps, lor his <i>Bridgewater
      Treatise on the Hand</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Dutch an eminent surgeon was Peter Camper (1722-1789), who, in
      order to acquire manual dexterity, learned to use various mechanical
      tools. He was a fruitful author, and did not consider it beneath his
      dignity to write a treatise about the best form of shoes, published in
      Vienna in 1782, but recently translated and republished in England as
      something new. Sandifort, of Leyden, discussed ruptures, dislocations,
      etc., and reported the first observation of downward dislocation of the
      femur.
    </p>
    <p>
      As already noted, the surgeons of the eighteenth century were often
      obstetricians,&mdash;William Hunter conspicuously. The<span class="pagenum">220</span><a
      name="link220" id="link220"></a> most important obstetrician of his time
      was William Smellie (1680-1763), of London, who invented numerous
      instruments, wrote a large treatise on the theory and practice of
      midwifery, and greatly advanced our knowledge of deformed pelves. He was
      the first to distinguish one diameter from the other, and to point out the
      importance of cephalic version and version of the breech. Parenthetically,
      it may be remarked that William Hunter, great as he was, was the
      uncompromising foe of instrumental midwifery, and was in the habit of
      showing his forceps, covered with rust, as evidence that he never resorted
      to such aids. A rival of Smellie and Hunter was Thomas Denman (1753-1815),
      best known, perhaps, because of his demonstration of the portability of
      puerperal infection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The researches of anatomists during the eighteenth century were, for the
      most part, directed toward the minute, more difficult, and less striking
      parts, and to increased thoroughness and accuracy of description.
      Microscopical anatomy suffered a relative quiescence. Pathological and
      general anatomy, which were destined to control the medicine of the
      succeeding century, were newly created and not yet regarded as sciences by
      themselves, but merely as special branches. The most important feature was
      the revival and more accurate study of experimental physiology, which had
      been scarcely resorted to since the time of Galen, except for Harvey's
      discoveries. This revival, which really seemed an epoch in the history of
      medicine, was effected by the great Haller (1708-1777), of Berne,&mdash;a
      man who really deserved the title of "Great," as he was a universal and
      indefatigable <i>savant</i>, possessed of thorough conscientiousness,
      marvelous capacity for work, great ingenuity, natural endowments, and an
      inextinguishable love for art and science; he was certainly one of the
      most versatile scholars and thinkers of any time, distinguished not only
      in his chosen field of medicine, but as a poet,<span class="pagenum">221</span><a
      name="link221" id="link221"></a> botanist, and statesman. Like all Swiss
      poets, he never passed beyond the didactic and the homely in his
      versification. From his tenth year he wrote poems in Latin and German, and
      even when eight years old had made most extensive compilations from
      Bayle's dictionary. At fifteen he went to the University of Tubingen,
      where, in the second year of his sojourn, he disputed with one of his
      teachers. In 1725 he went to Leyden, where Boerhaave and Albinus found in
      him a most indefatigable follower. At nineteen he received the degree of
      doctor. In the excess of his zeal for anatomy he purchased for a
      considerable sum, from Albinus, half of a corpse, the other half of which
      his teacher had dissected; and, while in Paris, he even engaged in
      grave-robbing, and, being betrayed by his own carelessness, was compelled
      to save himself by flight. In many other States, and in more than one
      country, he studied with the best of teachers, lecturing at times himself.
      At the age of twenty-six he became professor and hospital director at
      Berne, and in 1752 published his famous researches on irritability. Three
      years later he accepted a call to Gottingen as Professor of Anatomy,
      Surgery, Chemistry, and Botany. He was the founder of a botanical garden;
      for many years was so busy that he slept and lived in his library; and, in
      spite of his enormous and unique correspondence with the <i>savants</i> of
      the world, he never left a letter unanswered. Strange to say, his
      permanent influence upon the practice of medicine was only indirect; and,
      although he was professor of surgery, and performed many vivisections, he
      was never able to persuade himself to perform a single surgical operation
      upon the living human being. He it was that introduced into Germany the
      use of the watch in counting the pulse. Like Hunter, Haller demands a
      special historian, and it is possible here to outline only a few of the
      services he rendered to medicine. He enriched the anatomy of the heart, of
      the brain and dura, and pointed out the venous nature of the<span
      class="pagenum">222</span><a name="link222" id="link222"></a> sinuses;
      taught that the uterus should be regarded as a muscle: advanced the
      knowledge of the lymphatic system, and believed in and taught a
      developmental theory that every individual is descended or derived from a
      preceding one. In the mechanism of the heart his doctrine of irritability
      especially maintained itself. He administered the death-blow to the
      doctrine of vital spirits, and was, in fact, the father of modern
      nerve-physiology. His doctrine of irritability moved the minds of his
      century in a way that has no parallel, unless we compare it with the
      doctrine of Darwin. Glisson had established the general principles of
      irritability, and Haller followed, teaching it by the inductive method,
      and proving its existence by experiments,&mdash;proving, moreover, that it
      is a peculiarity of the muscular substance and not governed by ordinary
      sensation. His researches deserve the more credit because he lacked modern
      aids to physiological study. The first physiological institute was founded
      in Breslau by Purkinje, some fifty years ago. Haller had no such
      opportunity; even his successor, the great Müller, possessed no such
      advantages. The profound impression made by Haller's teachings may be
      measured by the number of his supporters and opponents; he was a great
      man, second only in wide-spread influence to Boerhaave, and one who left a
      more lasting impress upon the world than even the latter.

      The two best known of Haller's opponents were: Wolf (1733-179-4), of St.
      Petersburg, who regarded each generation as an actual new creation, and
      was the first to teach the doctrine of the blastodermic membranes; and
      Blumenbach (1752-1840), of Gotha, who did great service by investigations
      in general anthropology, of which he was, in fact, the founder, and whose
      researches in comparative anatomy and the history of development have
      rendered him famous.

    <p>
      Of the famous anatomists of the century may be mentioned Sommerring
      (1755-1830), of Frankfort,&mdash;the first to<span class="pagenum">223</span><a

      nerves from eacli other, and whose published works are well known, because
      of the beautiful illustrations furnished him by the well-known artist,
      Koeck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ablest French anatomist of the century was Winslow (1669-1760),&mdash;a
      man of Danish birth, but who became a professor in Paris, and is best
      known by the foramen named for him. There were, also, Portal (1742-1832),
      physician to Louis XVIII, who wrote a famous history of anatomy and
      surgery; and Vicq d'Azyr (1748-1794), known equally well for his labors in
      the department of anatomy, especially of the brain, nervous system,<span
      class="pagenum">224</span><a name="link224" id="link224"></a> and the
      vocal organs. Bichat (already mentioned) would deserve to be placed at the
      head of French anatomists were it not for his superior rank in clinical
      medicine.

      The founder of pathological anatomy as a science was Morgagni, born in
      1682, in Forli, Italy,&mdash;a pupil of Valsalva, and, at the age of
      nineteen, the assistant of the latter. It was not until his seventy-ninth
      year, after he had published several works, that he allowed his famous
      work on pathological anatomy to appear. This is the historical classic, De
      Seclibus et Causis Morborum, published in Venice in 1761. Its famous
      author did not cease work, even when he became blind, and to him we owe
      the maxim that observations should be "weighed, not counted." He was very
      versatile, and well informed in all branches of science and literature,
      and possessed a remarkable memory; likewise was the first to devote
      attention extensively and thoroughly to the anatomical products of common
      diseases, since, before his time, little had been regarded but rare
      discoveries in the body. He also called attention to the important bearing
      which the history of the disease has toward its products, and found his
      discoveries of advantage, even when they were unable to promote the cure
      of disease, because of the light which they threw upon physiology and
      normal anatomy, and because they prevented incurable patients from being
      continually tormented with drugs intended to cure them; also because
      pathological investigations alone could settle disputes in diagnosis and
      matters of honor among physicians. He died in 1772.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morgagni's legitimate successors in Great Britain were Baillie (
      1761-1823), a son of John Hunter's sister, and Sir Everard Home,&mdash;Hunter's
      brother-in-law,&mdash;who became professor in the Royal College of
      Surgeons, and was intrusted by Hunter with the work of describing his
      collection. Home, however, in a most discreditable way, burned several
      volumes of Hunter's own descriptions, in order to appropriate to himself
      the sole credit of the work. He has<span class="pagenum">225</span><a
      name="link225" id="link225"></a> gone down to fame especially because of
      his book on the prostate.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most notable events in the history of medicine was the
      introduction of the systematic practice of <i>preventive inoculation
      against small-pox</i>. It is so generally taught that this is entirely due
      to the efforts of Jenner&mdash;or, rather, we are so often allowed to
      think it, without being taught otherwise&mdash;that the measure deserves
      an historical sketch. The communication of the natural disease to the
      healthy, in order to afford protection,&mdash;or, in other words, the
      communication of small-pox to prevent the same,&mdash;reaches back into
      antiquity. It is mentioned in the Sanscrit Yedas as performed by Brahmins,
      who employed pus procured from small-pox vesicles a year before. They
      rubbed the place selected for operation until the skin was red, then
      scratched with a sharp instrument, and laid upon it cotton soaked in the
      variolous pus, moistened with water from the sacred Ganges. Along with
      this measure they insisted upon careful hygienic regulations, to which, in
      large measure, their good results were due. Among the Chinese was
      practiced what was known as "pock-sowing," and ten centuries before Christ
      the Celestials introduced into the nasal cavities of young children
      pledgets of cotton saturated with variolous pus. The Arabians inoculated
      with needles, and so did the Circassians, while in North Africa incisions
      were made between the fingers, and among some of the negroes inoculation
      was performed in or upon the nose. In Constantinople, under the Greeks,
      the custom had long been naturalized, and was practiced by old women,
      instructed in the art, who regarded it as a revelation of Saint Mary. The
      first accounts of this practice were given to the Royal Society by Timoni,
      a physician of Constantinople, in 1714. The actual introduction of the
      practice into the West, however, was due to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who
      died in 1762, and who was wife of the English Ambassador to the Porte in
      1717. She had<span class="pagenum">226</span><a name="link226" id="link226"></a>
      her son inoculated in Constantinople, by Maitland, and on her return to
      London, in 1721, her daughter also was inoculated. During the same years
      experiments were undertaken by Maitland upon criminals, and, as these
      turned out favorably, the Prince of Wales and his sisters were inoculated
      by Mead. The practice was then more or less speedily adopted on this side
      of the Atlantic, but suffered occasional severe blows, because of
      unfortunate cases here and there, such as never can be avoided. The
      clergy, especially, using the Scripture, as designing men can always do,
      became warm opponents of the practice, and stigmatized it as an atrocious
      invasion of the divine prerogative. Nevertheless, in 1746 the Bishop of
      Worcester recommended it from the pulpit, established houses for
      inoculation, and thus made it again popular. In Germany it was generally
      favored, and a little later came into vogue in France and Italy. In 1757
      Robert Sutton, near London, professed to have made fifteen thousand
      inoculations without a single fatal case; he kept his patients on a strict
      diet for nine days, then inoculated with the smallest possible quantity of
      virus. The operation was not prohibited in England until the year 1840,
      although it involved much greater dangers than vaccination with cow-pox.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first inoculation with cow-pox seems to have been performed in 1774:
      by a farmer of Gloucester, named Jesty, though the pioneer in the
      extensive and general introduction of this method was Edward Jenner
      (1749-1823), of Berkeley, in Gloucestershire, who, therefore, is generally
      known as the "Father of Vaccination." The son of a clergyman, he began
      early the study of medicine and surgery, and during his apprenticeship
      received from a milkmaid information of the protective power of cow-pox
      against variola, as established by popular observation. (Sutton and others
      had proved that inoculation of <i>sheep</i>-pox was not efficient.) This
      communication so struck Jenner as a means of affording protection to the
      whole human race<span class="pagenum">227</span><a name="link227"
      id="link227"></a> that the subject never afterward left his mind. In 1770
      he became a pupil of John Hunter, and when he communicated to him this
      idea the great surgeon said: "Do not think; investigate!" Accordingly he
      went to Berkeley and performed the little operation which has made him
      famous; and from 1778 until 1788 he communicated to Sir Everard Home such
      observations as he had made. But the first vaccination was performed in
      1796, upon a boy, with matter from the hand of a maid who had contracted
      cow-pox in milking.

      In 1798 he published his memorable work, and afterward removed to London.
      He died full of fame and honor, in his native place, having-received
      rewards from the government amounting to one hundred and fifty thousand
      dollars, besides being made an honorary citizen of the city of London. The
      subsequent wide-spread practice of the method, and the formation of
      societies<span class="pagenum">228</span><a name="link228" id="link228"></a>
      for the promotion of vaccination are matters of recent history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first vaccinations in the United States were performed by Doctor
      Waterhouse, Professor of Medicine in Harvard College, in 1800, upon four
      of his own children. The transmission of humanized virus through the
      system of the cow, and its subsequent employment in vaccination of human
      beings, was first practiced by Troja (1747-1827), of Naples, shortly after
      the introduction of human vaccination; but in 1810 this was prohibited in
      Italy. Compulsory vaccination was first extensively introduced in Germany
      in 1807; in England it was first legalized in 1827. The occasional
      temporary character of the protection thus afforded was first taught by
      Elsâsser in 1814. Schoenlein was the first to call attention to the
      distinction between variola and varioloid.
    </p>

      Another matter in which the eighteenth century witnessed great reform was
      the <i>treatment of the insane</i>, which continued in very bad condition
      until toward the close of the century, when a movement for improvement
      began. From and after this lunatics were liberated from their fetters and
      from the hands of brutal keepers, and regarded as actually ill, while
      so-called schools of psychiatry were founded. While the first impulse in
      this direction was given by Lorry, the true reformer was Pinel, already
      mentioned, who did away with corporeal punishment and abuse, separated the
      insane from convicts, limited the employment of drugs and especially
      venesection, placed the unfortunates in special institutions under the
      charge of physicians, and classified patients according to their symptoms.
      Yet, in spite of his humane teachings, lunatics were found incarcerated in
      cages in some of the French cities as late as 1834. Pinel was followed by
      Esquirol (1772-1840), who in 1818 established the first clinic for mental
      diseases.

      It is well known what a conspicuous part <i>public baths</i> played in the
      social life of the ancient Greeks and Romans, but<span class="pagenum">229</span><a
      name="link229" id="link229"></a> the first public resort for sea-bathing
      was established in Germany in 1794. The cold-water epoch of this century,
      however, began with the researches of Hahn (16961773), a Silesian, who
      introduced a systematic and almost exclusive hydrotherapeutic method. The
      modern method of using cold water as an antipyretic agent was first
      employed in England, in 1797, by Currie, who originally was an American
      merchant. In France the method found little sympathy, but it made its way
      even to Spain later, where it was adopted by the famous Sangrado, who is
      well known to readers of <i>Gil Blas</i>.

      century, up to its close, was the golden age of medicine, is due to the
      prevalence during that period of a strong idealistic undertone, as a
      result of which any learned occupation caused the scholar to be held in
      higher esteem than is the case even to-day. Medicine was then regarded as
      <i>a conscientious vocation</i> and not as a mere business or trade;
      indeed, general scientific knowledge more widely prevailed among the
      better class of the profession, and there was much less of that one-sided,
      narrow education that obtains to-day. The profession, moreover, was not
      overcrowded; physicians were neither too few nor too numerous,
      consequently their social position was higher. Again, the relations
      between doctor and patient were more intimate, most practitioners being of
      the type described as "family physicians," and those possessed of the
      doctorate degree ranked among the gentry rather than as artisans. They
      were, for the most part, fully devoted to their calling; moreover, the
      State took greater care to protect the people, so that it became dangerous
      for strolling vagabonds and imposters to attempt to trifle with human life
      and excite the vulgar to the prejudice of scientific knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The<span class="pagenum">231</span><a name="link231" id="link231"></a>
      pursuit of anatomical studies was now facilitated, despite the fact that
      students were frequently compelled to take long journeys in order to
      obtain the "material" therefor. In the early part of the century so great
      was the lack of dissecting material that the great Haller while in Paris
      was compelled to purloin his cadavers, and ultimately, on discovery of
      this fact, to fly for his life; Hoffmann was only able to make twenty
      dissections during twenty-four years; even in the middle of the century
      there was only one dissection annually in Halle; up to 1712 there had been
      only three dissections in a score of years&mdash;though now subjects can
      be had there in abundance at a ridiculously low figure; cadavers were
      extremely scarce in Vienna as late as 1765; and for a long time the only
      places in London where the study of anatomy could be legally pursued were
      the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons, and the trouble
      that hampered John Hunter in this direction is historical. The crime of
      "Burking" became known in Hunter's day. Murder was committed, and the
      victim sold for purposes of dissection&mdash;for at this time, as
      "body-snatching" was a necessity, those that purchased cadavers asked few
      questions, and the fees paid were, of course, high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first clinical institution in Austria was organized in Vienna, in
      1754, by Van Swieten, though there was an "ambulatory clinic" (out-patient
      department) in Prague nine years before. During the century, however,
      hospitals were everywhere in bad condition. In the Hôtel-Dieu, at Paris,
      several patients&mdash;even as many as six&mdash;were sometimes put in the
      same bed; the convalescent and the dying found themselves thus associated;
      in Vienna the Allgemeines Krankenhaus was composed of seventeen hospitals
      that subsequently were amalgamated into one. In London numerous hospitals
      were founded, and as the medical staff of each became eminent they
      attracted numerous pupils; but later it became necessary to relieve the
      hospital wards, and private institutions for instruction were established
      by popular<span class="pagenum">232</span><a name="link232" id="link232"></a>
      teachers, the most celebrated being the "Windmill Street School of
      Anatomy," founded by William Hunter about 1770, and the private school of
      Sir William Blizzard, which, established in 1780, developed, five years
      later, into the London Hospital Medical School.
    </p>
    <p>
      While few, if any, of the lectures were compulsory, particularly in the
      natural sciences, even more attention than now was bestowed upon the
      accessory branches; botany, chemistry, and natural history were the
      recreation of many students and physicians. Pupils enjoyed the privilege
      of studying what they pleased&mdash;as they do practically to-day in the
      Portuguese University of Coimbra,&mdash;and professors exercised to the
      utmost their individuality in teaching. In Spain natural sciences found no
      admission, and even so late as 1770 no instruction in these branches was
      given, as they were regarded as dangerous to the purity of the faith;
      mineralogy for mining purposes was an exception, for even the most
      faithful Catholic needs money.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the universities medical students were not permitted to go out without
      their scholastic cloaks,&mdash;a regulation that still obtains in Spain.
      That the number of students has enormously multiplied may be seen from the
      fact that the little University of Giessen, with scarcely any medical
      school at all, has always more students than had Halle in the days of the
      famous Hoffmann. In the middle of the last century Würzburg had at one
      time but <i>three</i> medical students, while to-day it has in the
      neighborhood of five hundred. Even then it was complained that, on account
      of the number of students, there was an educated proletariat arising, and
      in 1791 it was proposed, in Austria, that the rush for study should be
      repressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Continental students the revels and bad behavior of past
      centuries were not to any great extent corrected; fights and debauchery
      were very common, and all sorts of orgies and bacchanals prevailed. The
      professors were, in large measure, independent of the State, and a single<span
      class="pagenum">233</span><a name="link233" id="link233"></a> individual
      often represented a number of branches now taught by special chairs. When
      indisposed to lecture, they simply posted upon the blackboard: "<i>Hodie
      non legitur</i>," and this was the end of the matter. In 1777 Vienna had
      one hundred and forty-seven medical teachers, and in Germany there were
      two to every thirty-nine students. That in the last century one man often
      accomplished more than a great number of average teachers do to-day is
      amply demonstrated by the lives of Boerhaave, Haller, and others. Then,
      too, the Latin tongue was generally employed for purposes of instruction,
      though surgeons, for the most part, lectured in the vernacular; Cullen, in
      1770, was the first in Great Britain to deliver purely medical lectures in
      English; and as the clergy gradually retired from the ranks of the
      profession, Latin more and more fell into disuse. Strange to say, as the
      clerical influence waned, the Jews began to enter medicine, the movement
      beginning about 1791, in France, under the promulgation of "civil
      equality" ideas; previously the Hebrews had been an almost universally
      suppressed people, and in Berlin were permitted to enter and leave the
      city by only one gate, and were forbidden to learn or write pure German,
      in consequence whereof their dialect was an Hebraic-Teutonic jargon, that
      even to-day prevails in some portions of western Europe. Educated Jews
      were few in number, since attendance upon universities was ordinarily
      denied them, although long before they had been admitted at Salamanca,
      Toledo, Salernum, and Montpellier. In Austria the prohibition was not
      removed until 1789, and even then, so bitter was the prejudice against the
      Semitic race, the clergy vigorously protested. It was the same clerical
      body that, in 1667, protested with the greatest vehemence against allowing
      Hebrew physicians to pass through the gates of Wurtemburg without paying
      toll, declaring that it was "better to die with Christ than be cured by
      Jews, who were aided by the devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Professors<span class="pagenum">234</span><a name="link234" id="link234"></a>
      were often attached to the courts of their various sovereigns, and at one
      time the French court possessed a faculty of forty-eight physicians,
      surgeons, and apothecaries, the first two physicians being required to
      attend every morning when the king arose; hence originated the titles,
      still known in Germany, of "Hofrath" and "Geheimrath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical fees, as a rule, were very small, though there were exceptional
      instances in which enormous sums were bestowed: Joseph II, of Austria,
      gave Guerin, who was summoned from Paris in consultation, an honorarium of
      171,000 marks and made him a baronet. Taking all things into
      consideration, the income of the average practitioner in the eighteenth
      century would be in the neighborhood of $1000, which, however, was
      equivalent to three times that amount to-day. Fothergill, whose highest
      income in a single year was $25,000, bequeathed to the poor of London
      $1,000,000; Sir Astley Cooper had a yearly income of from $75,000 to
      $100,000, but it may be remembered that his practice during the first year
      netted him just $26, and that it was four years later before his income
      reached the sum of $500.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician of the last century was, at least, on occasions of moment,
      very different from other men, and to be recognized by his dress. A cap
      was placed upon his head when he graduated, in recognition of the fact
      that physicians at an earlier period belonged to the learned or clerical
      profession; and in later life he wore a purplish or scarlet cloak (to
      distinguish him from lawyers, whose professional color was yellow, and
      from theologians, who then, as now, sported the sombre black). The
      regulation full-dress costume of the English physician of the last century
      demanded a well-powdered wig, silk coat, knee breeches with stockings,
      buckled shoes, lace ruffles, cap, and goldheaded cane, to which, in cold
      weather, was added a muff&mdash;to preserve his delicacy of touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surgeons<span class="pagenum">235</span><a name="link235" id="link235"></a>
      were still strictly separated from physicians, even in education; nor were
      they esteemed as equal in rank, until the French Revolution brought about
      the doctrine of civil equality; perhaps this is one reason why this branch
      of the medical art made less conspicuous progress until recent times. The
      change was brought about, in France, by the abolition of eighteen
      universities and fifteen colleges of medicine, the Royal Society of
      Medicine (founded in 1776), and the Academy of Surgery (founded in 1731);
      but by this abolition charlatanism acquired such speedy control that the
      arrangement was soon abandoned. Thus it came about that surgical
      instruction was given in special institutions or in the universities, and
      the conditions of instruction finally improved. When the College of St.
      Come was abolished in 1753 the Société de Chirurgie, founded in 1731,
      became the Académie de Chirurgie; and, when the French Academy was formed
      in 1795, the Académie was merged into its medical department. The École
      Pratique, where Desault and Chopart taught, was established in 1750 for
      the practical education of surgeons. In England the Royal College of
      Surgeons was not incorporated until 1800. In Austria, in 1785, the
      Josephinum was opened by Joseph II, who also erected permanent military
      hospitals in Prague, Brünn, Milan, Mantua, Pesth, Olmütz, etc.; he also
      created the "Joseph's Akademie" in order to educate military surgeons and
      thus overcome the defects of army surgery; the Josephinum unquestionably
      exerted great influence in elevating the social and military position of
      army surgeons and attained historical importance after Brambilla compelled
      the recognition of surgeons as social equals of other members of the
      medical profession. As the result of these improvements, the various
      armies of Europe were soon furnished with better medical officers. Prior
      to this, too, the field hospitals had been as badly mismanaged as their
      civil prototypes, and the substitution, in 1793, of movable hospitals, as
      suggested at<span class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236" id="link236"></a>
      the close of the sixteenth century by Henry IV, of France, was scarcely an
      improvement. The whole system suffered from perpetuation of the dual and
      distinct functions of the physician and the surgeon, to destroy which was
      a part of the design of the Josephinum. How unpleasant was the position of
      the army surgeon up to this date may be inferred from the fact that in
      1758 one was subjected to corporeal punishment at the command of his
      colonel, and that a general upon his death-bed could leave orders that
      fifty blows be given each of his medical staff in case the post-mortem
      disproved the diagnosis.

      In Austria, at the beginning of the Seven Years' War, all military
      surgeons of the Protestant faith were compelled to become Catholics or
      leave the service. The condition of the wounded soldiers was as deplorable
      as can well be imagined; but upon this subject I cannot dwell.

      The tendency of the nineteenth century seems to be a continuation, and,
      perhaps, in some respects, an exaggeration, of the condition obtaining in
      France during the previous century; in other words, the world has become
      practically an enormous school of pathological anatomy and diagnosis,&mdash;a
      school inaugurated by Bichat, as representing so-called scientific or
      exact medicine. Philosophically this has been a century of reaction
      against the idealism of the preceding age; it places the individual,
      rather than the idea, in the foregound. The mutual influence of medicine,
      philosophy, and the natural sciences is less conspicuous now than
      formerly. Recent philosophers who have exercised the greatest influence
      are: Schelling, who held to the equality of the real and the ideal; Hegel,
      whose supreme principle was absolute reason, of which religion was
      regarded as a representation; Hartmann, whose philosophy of the
      "unconscious" depends largely upon the results of natural sciences,
      embraces Darwinism, and is, in many respects, an extension and completion
      of Schopenhauer's<span class="pagenum">237</span><a name="link237"
      id="link237"></a> pessimism and doctrine of the soul. But one who has
      exercised still more influence upon our profession is Comte, whose
      positivism contrasted strongly with the idealism and atheism of Schelling,
      and who required only this of philosophy,&mdash;namely, that it should
      work out the general ideas and results of other sciences; his most
      important follower was Claude Bernard, and upon these two the whole exact
      school of France is based. But the most influential philosophic doctrines
      of this or any other century have been those emanating from Charles
      Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Ernst Haeckel, Alfred Wallace, and their
      contemporaries and followers. Darwin (1809-1882) was the grandson of
      Erasmus Darwin, already mentioned, and his <i>Variation of Animals and
      Plants Under Domes-tication, Origin of Species, and Descent of Man</i>
      have found a place in all modern languages. The system known by his name
      is the pure science of nature, is founded upon scientific investigation,
      and by its merits alone has found almost universal acceptance; it has been
      added to and further elucidated by the efforts of Haeckel and Spencer.

      When it is declared that medicine of the present is influenced by no
      system, it is speedily found, on critical analysis, that this is an error.
      It necessarily follows the realistic and materialistic as readily as it
      did the teachings and doctrines of natural philosophy; and, in
      consequence, "medical thought," so called, is just as one-sided to-day as
      at any time in the history of the art. The watchword of to-day, natural
      specific tendency, veils, but does not take away, its philosophic
      principles, and so our ridicule of earlier medical systems is quite
      unjustifiable. A modern historian aptly remarks that the medicine of the
      present "embraces nothing but a theorem of investigation by the senses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Discoveries in botany, the result of better knowledge of natural history
      and more accurate habits of study, have influenced<span class="pagenum">238</span><a
      name="link238" id="link238"></a> modern progress not a little; have led to
      better classification and broader knowledge. The natural system of de
      Candolle (1778-1841) of Geneva, and of Endlicher, of Vienna, called into
      existence the so-called natural historical school of medicine; the
      researches into plant-cells by Schleiden and Baumgartner, and the almost
      contemporaneous discovery of animal cells by Schwann became, in course of
      time, the origin of recent cellular pathology; then came microscopic
      botany, and the influence of the lower fungi in the production of
      fermentation and putrefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly too, the laws of physics have been shown to have an inseparable
      connection with anatomy and physiology, and their study has become a most
      important aid in the experimental researches of to-day; through Helmholz
      they brought in the ophthalmoscope; thermal electricity, for the discovery
      of which medicine is indebted to Seebeck; a better knowledge of optics,
      thanks to Fraunhofer, who was equally expert in electricity; spectrum
      analysis, invented by Kirchhoff; and the varied efforts of Faraday, Graham
      Bell, Thomas Alva Edison, and Daguerre, the latter better known for his
      invention of photography. Finally, medicine is immeasurably indebted to
      Tyndall and Huxley for their teaching of the correlation and conservation
      of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chemistry also has performed its share, and, as applied to physiology, is
      a discovery almost wholly within the present century. The new nomenclature
      serves a practical purpose in that it is now possible to portray chemical
      combinations and isomerism in a graphic, and at least, semi-comprehensive
      way. Among the chemists may be specially mentioned Bertholet, whose laws
      are as well known as they are succinct; Humboldt; Berzelius; Dumas;
      Chevreuil, who recently died at the age of almost one hundred years;
      Magendie; Orfila, the toxicologist; Gmelin, eminent in physiological
      chemistry; Rose, perfecter of organic analysis; Wohler,<span
      class="pagenum">239</span><a name="link239" id="link239"></a> who first
      made organic alkaloids; Bunsen; Sir Humphry Davy; Marsh; Faraday; Graham;
      Young, who first showed the industrial value of coal; and Gay-Lussac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon medicine, zoology also, with comparative anatomy and physiology, has
      had a wonderful influence; here may be noted the names of Cuvier, Oken,
      Bilharz, Brehm, Wagner, Leuckart, Richard Owen, William Carpenter, and
      last, but by no means least, Thomas Huxley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps the most significant feature of the age has been the wonderful
      development of scientific associations and the publication of medical and
      scientific literature. Whether these have yet reached their climax is
      perhaps an open question, but the consequent widening circle of readers,
      as well as of writers, seems to imply that there will be for a long time
      to come no lack of activity in this direction. In the United States more
      than in any other country medical societies and associations innumerable
      have sprung up, and to such a degree that (in the eastern States at least)
      there are few counties that cannot boast of a medical organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the present century foreign universities have decreased in number,
      partly owing to consolidations and partly by surrender of charters; for
      instance, the old University of Ingolstadt was united with that of
      Landshut, and in 1827 was removed to Munich; in 1816 the University of
      Wurtemburg was united with that of Halle; the University of Bonn was
      abolished in 1792, but revived in 1818. A few new universities, like that
      of Zürich, have been founded. In the quaint old town of Prague the old
      German university was, in 1883, divided, and there now exist in that city
      two universities side by side, in one of which German is spoken, in the
      other Bohemian.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will thus be seen that the nineteenth century is essentially an era of
      modern science, with whose dawn was sounded the death-knell of the "demon
      of disease" and his twin<span class="pagenum">240</span><a name="link240"
      id="link240"></a> brother "visitation." In 1801 the first experiment in
      steam-navigation took place upon the Thames. In 1807 the slave-trade in
      England was abolished by Parliament. The theological part has entirely
      faded out of medicine; and the era of accurate scientific experimentation
      which long since dawned, is now, so far as we can see, at its height,
      since it is difficult to conceive of much improvement upon its methods
      under existing conditions, or of greater enthusiasm than has been already
      manifested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, regarding some of the systems and theories of this age. The systems
      of the past have been more or less long-lived,&mdash;as, for instance,
      those of Dogmatism and of Galen,&mdash;while as we come closer to the
      present they become more ephemeral. Those of the early part of the present
      century took root in the soil of the eighteenth,&mdash;for instance, the
      so-called <i>theory of excitement</i> of Roeschlaub (1768-1835), which
      endeavored to mold into one the Brunonian errors and the fancies of
      Schelling. According to it, life depends upon irritability, but is
      inherent in the organism as an independent feature; so it recognizes both
      irritability and solidism, while Brown considered the former alone,
      adding, as an after-thought, a chemical or qualitative potency (oxygen),
      in order to account for alterations of quality. Roeschlaub inclined first
      toward natural philosophy, then, owing to an inherent theological and
      polemical bias (he was originally intended for the church), to mysticism
      and theosophy; finally, with a courage almost unexampled, he upset all his
      former teachings by admitting he was mistaken. To him was opposed
      Hufeland, who wrote on the <i>Lengthening of Life</i>, was noted for a
      warm and benevolent heart, and possessed no small penetration, as is
      evidenced by his aphorism, "Successful treatment requires one-third
      science and two-thirds '<i>savoir faire</i>.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Stimolo</i> and <i>contrastimolo</i> were titles applied to a theory
      advanced by Rasori (1762-1837), of Milan, that combined Methodism with
      Brunonism; by Baas it is characterized<span class="pagenum">241</span><a
      name="link241" id="link241"></a> as a "genuine blot upon the human heart
      beyond any other of the various systems." Long centuries of experience and
      the conclusions of great and venerable minds may go for naught, as Rasori
      abundantly demonstrated. The theories of Brown were then taught as his own
      to his classes in Pavia, showing he was not above plagiarism; his <i>stimolo</i>
      corresponded to the sthenic diathesis devised by Brown, while his system
      consisted of an endeavor to make a diagnosis by watching the effects of
      drugs. Bleeding was held to be the best measure; if it did the patient
      good, the sthenic diathesis was assumed; if it made him worse, the
      asthenic was certain. He gave enormous doses of powerful drugs&mdash;sixty
      grains of gamboge, and from two to three ounces of saltpeter in a single
      day. Is it strange that homoeopathy or any other heterodox system sprang
      up in the midst of such measures? It is an old saying that there is no
      folly which will not secure a following; and, strange to say, Rasori had a
      numerous and an eminent one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As just intimated, Homoeopathy was the natural reaction against such
      heroic measures; in the rebound the other extreme was reached, even to
      practical therapeutic nihilism. Now, instead of venesection and drastic
      medication, came the theories expounded by Hahnemann (1753-1843), which <i>denied
      disease, admitting only symptoms</i>. This apostle of homoeopathy was the
      son of a porcelain-painter in Meissen; he studied in Leipzig and in
      Vienna, and later practiced in various cities, including Dresden and
      Leipzig. "<i>Similia similibus curantur</i>" was not original with him, as
      it long before had been formulated by Hippocrates, and later by
      Paracelsus. Of the life and labors of Hahnemann, much might be told; but
      this is not the time or place to go into the subject.

      An offshoot of homoeopathy, which demands only the harshest criticism, is
      Isopathy,&mdash;perhaps the filthiest theory ever invented,&mdash;according
      to which like is to be cured by like, and to such an extent that small-pox
      is to be treated by variolous pus, tape-worm by the ingestion of the
      proglottides, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of the rankest of fraudulent outgrowths is the so-called
      Electrohomceopathic system of Count Mattei, who prates of "red," "blue"
      and "green" electricity,&mdash;a theory that, in spite of its utter
      idiocy, has attracted a considerable following and earned a fortune for
      its chief promoter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of the vagaries of the earlier portion of the present century, and
      that still survives, in a weak way, is Cranioscopy, or Phrenology. Gall
      expounded his doctrines at Vienna as early as 1796, but, being expelled,
      went to Germany, where he was joined by Spurzheim, who, though much<span
      class="pagenum">243</span><a name="link243" id="link243"></a> more of a
      student and scientist, accepted the doctrine of the former with
      enthusiasm; and it was chiefly due to the efforts of Spurzheim that
      phrenology was introduced into England, and later (1832) into America.
      Gall assumed to locate twenty-seven different organs alongside of each
      other in the brain, and held that external markings on the skull were
      guides to the development of the various parts. Every neophyte in anatomy
      knows how little foundation there is for such a doctrine, but for a time
      it attracted great attention, and there are to-day certain men and women
      who make their living out of this imposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Physiological Theory of Medicine was originated by Broussais
      (1772-1838), and combined the views of Pinel and Bichat with the
      "sympathetic" view of Hoffmann, the "concealed inflammation" of Stoll, and
      the theory of inflammation held by Marcus. Broussais had been a pupil of
      Bichat. In 1814 he began hospital teaching, and in 1831 was made
      professor. Personally very vain, quick-tempered, even belligerent, as a
      therapeutist he was a man of routine. He was, perhaps, best known shortly
      before his death, when delivering lectures on phrenology. According to
      him, life depends upon external irritation, produced by heat, which
      excites new chemical processes, while these in turn stimulate
      regeneration, assimilation, as well as contractility, and sensibility.
      When the functions supported by heat cease, death ensues. Health depends
      upon moderate action of external irritants; disease, upon either their
      weakness or their extraordinary strength. He saw nothing ontological about
      disease. In therapeutics he admitted the healing power of Nature, but
      regarded the physician not as a minister, but as a lord of Nature. Febrile
      and inflammatory diseases were all treated by the withdrawal of
      nourishment, carried to the extreme. His most powerful antiphlogistic
      treatment consisted in the application of leeches to the abdomen,<span
      class="pagenum">244</span><a name="link244" id="link244"></a> and to
      robust individuals he applied from thirty to fifty at once It is not,
      then, to be wondered at that, in consequence of his so-called
      "hirudinomania," leeches became very scarce In the year 1833 forty-one
      million five hundred thousand leeches were imported into France, while in
      1824 one-twentieth of this number sufficed to supply the demand. Even in
      cases of worms, the abdominal integument had to pay its blood-tribute,
      particularly if enteritis prevailed. He only allowed a spare diet of
      mucilaginous and acid drinks. In mercurial France and Italy he gained
      numerous followers, but they were few and far between in practical,
      hard-headed Germany and England. His best follower was Bouillaud
      (1797-1881), who adopted the symptomatic nature of fever and the
      sanguinary therapeutics of his master, but used the lancet more than the
      leech. As the homoeopaths regard Hahnemann, so Bouillaud looked up to
      Broussais as the Messiah of medicine and science, which, as Baas says were
      "already greatly overstocked with Messiahs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Contemporaneous with the school of Broussais, and its antagonist in all
      respects, was the Paris School of Pathological Anatomy and Diagnosis,
      which has given tone to all medical art. It made it the duty of the
      physician to search for changes in the human body, to investigate the
      local products of disease, and assigned to medicine the duty of removing
      these products. The tendency of its teaching was to treat the patient
      rather as a living cadaver than as a sentient being endowed with vital
      forces, and the charge which Asclepiades once falsely made against
      Hippocrates was revived upon new grounds. Kratzmann wrote some years ago:
      "In France every one experiments on the sick, less to attain the best
      method of cure than to enrich science with an interesting discovery and to
      advance the accuracy of diagnosis by some new physical sign." The
      seductiveness of this system promoted still more onesidedness, which
      finally almost attained the belief that the science<span class="pagenum">245</span><a
      name="link245" id="link245"></a> of medicine really originated in the
      Anatomical School of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forerunners of this school were Bichat and Pinel, and its proper
      founders were Corvisart, Dupuytren, and Laënnec. There was also Bayle, who
      was first to apply the ear to the thorax in disease of the heart, and thus
      became the predecessor of Laënnec and Chomel. He was the godfather of
      typhoid fever, and from being a famous clinician became later a great
      pathologist. The most celebrated adherent of the method, however, was
      Cruveilhier (1791-1873), professor first in Montpellier and then in Paris,
      who revived the Anatomical Society founded by Bichat, and wrote his first
      essays as the result of Dupuytren's advice; finally, there came from his
      pen the famous treatise on <i>Pathological Anatomy</i>, with its
      magnificent plates,&mdash;a work begun in 1830 and not fully completed
      until 1864. Like Morgagni, he associated general and pathological anatomy
      with bedside observations; also established a class of inflammations to
      which belong gangrene and atony, and a certain class of neuroses and
      fevers, and endeavored to investigate the different steps in the
      development of lesions, not simply their final products. His teachings
      concerning pyæmia and phlebitis, which had been first studied by John
      Hunter, excited great attention, and he even came to the one-sided
      conclusion that "phlebitis rules the whole of pathology." He was the first
      to observe that its suppurative form does not occur primarily, but is
      secondary to coagulation of the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ablest representative of this school, and one who, perhaps, more than
      any other man, made Paris a Mecca to which foreigners made their
      pilgrimages, was Andral (1797-1876),&mdash;the son of a physician and the
      most noted and indefatigable investigator and thinker of his time. Between
      1823 and 1840 were published the five volumes of his <i>Medical Clinic</i>,
      which made him famous. He taught, in opposition to Broussais, the
      existence of primary diseases<span class="pagenum">246</span><a
      name="link246" id="link246"></a> of the blood, the so-called dyscrasiæ;
      made physiology subservient to pathology; was the creator of the chemistry
      of the blood; and in therapeutics was wedded to emetics and cathartics,
      ascribing little importance to abstraction of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man to apply the Numerical Method to pathology, and who brought
      about the downfall of Broussais, was Louis (1787-1872), who had studied in
      Russia, but came to Paris while still a young man. He expressed his
      principle in the following words: "As often as I have formed an <i>a
      priori</i> idea and had afterward opportunity to prove the facts, I have
      invariably found that my idea was false. In pathology as well as in
      therapeutics numerical analysis is a useful practice. By numbers only can
      be obtained the frequency of conditions or this or that symptom; by a
      definite enumeration alone is it possible to utilize the special relations
      of age, sex, constitution of our patients, to settle that this or that
      symptom occurs so often in one hundred or one thousand cases." This system
      he applied to etiology, symptomatology, prognosis, therapeutics, and
      pathological anatomy. He discarded blisters and condemned large bleedings,
      but fell into other errors, carrying his numerical method to an
      unjustifiable extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to Andral and Louis should be mentioned Magendie (1783-1855),
      Professor of General Pathology in the College de France, and physician to
      the Hôtel-Dieu, who was a representative of the new French medicine, and
      introduced experiments into both pathology and physiology; he was the
      pioneer in experimental pharmacodynamics, which occupies itself largely
      with alkalies, a large number of which he introduced into practice. He was
      a solid humoralist in pathology, a most accurate diagnostician, but (it is
      charged) "was too simple in therapeutics"! As a result of his intravenous
      injections of putrefactive material, he had the terms "pyæmia,"
      "icliorrhæmia," and "metastasis" introduced into pathology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trousseau<span class="pagenum">247</span><a name="link247" id="link247"></a>
      (1801-1866), of Tours, also became professor in the Paris Faculty, and
      rendered especial service in his studies of croup and the employment
      therefor of tracheotomy, though his chief fame rests upon his merit as a
      clinical teacher and the publication of clinical lectures which are still
      models in every way of accurate, forcible teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claude Bernard (1813-1878) became the successor of Magendie, and even more
      famous as an experimenter in pathology, physiology, and anatomy.
      Originally a poet, he finally turned to medicine and science, and in 1869
      became a member of the French Academy.

      One of the results of the French fondness for pathological anatomy was an
      outgrowth, unfortunate in some respects, of specialism, which made its
      appearance early and spread to other countries, particularly to Germany,
      so that to-day there is scarcely an organ in the body which has not only
      its special student, but its special representative in medicine. It would
      be of interest to go over some of the various organs and count those who
      have become most renowned in the study of their diseases, but that is
      beyond the scope of this volume.

      As Baas says, England, after her excessive participation in the
      iatrochemistrv and iatromechanics of the seventeenth century, with a
      devotion that extended far into the eighteenth, seemed then to lose all
      confidence in systems and schools of medicine, inasmuch as since that time
      no system or so-called school has gained in Great Britain any large or
      permanent band of followers; even Brunonianism did not succeed in this
      respect. This form of conservatism is a characteristic of the British
      race. But while schools have not risen, individuals have formulated
      hypotheses or doctrines that at least attracted attention, if not
      followers. For instance, John Mason Goode (1764-1827) formulated an
      intricate nosological arrangement in his long-popular text-book entitled
      <i>The Study of Medicine</i>, and<span class="pagenum">248</span><a
      name="link248" id="link248"></a> also arranged a classification of
      diseases now almost forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1816 Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842) made the memorable discovery that the
      posterior roots of the spinal nerves preside over sensation, and the
      anterior over motion; and this attracted anew the attention of English
      physicians to the nervous system, and was rewarded by the later discovery
      of reflex action or reflex phenomena, communicated to the Royal Society in
      1863 by Marshall Hall. Both discoveries were important, and both were duly
      rewarded by yet others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin Travers (1783-1858) seems to have been greatly influenced by the
      first of these discoveries, and led thereby to pay special attention to
      what he termed "constitutional irritation"; his studies on this subject
      are often quoted to-day, and are well worthy of perusal; he understood by
      this term a process (in strong contrast with inflammation) which subsides
      without hyperæmia and without plastic exudate, but which, on the other
      hand, may occasion liquid products and result in neoplasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contemporaries of Travers were: Abram Colles; John Cheyne (1777-1830), of
      Dublin, who wrote on <i>Diseases of Children</i> and described
      "Cheyne-Stokes respiration." William Stokes (1804-1878), also of Dublin,
      who distinguished himself in 1857 by a great work, entitled <i>A Treatise
      on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases of the Chest</i>; Robert Graves
      (1797-1853), Professor of Medicine in the King's and Queen's College,
      Dublin, who published clinical lectures of his own, besides many clinical
      reports in connection with Stokes. Graves was one of the first to oppose
      the "absolute diet" of the earlier physicians in the management of febrile
      maladies, and requested that his epitaph should have but one line&mdash;"He
      fed fevers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The School of Natural Philosophy" was the title applied to a system
      which, in Germany, ran parallel with that of Broussais, being the
      legitimate outcome of the medical<span class="pagenum">249</span><a
      name="link249" id="link249"></a> philosophy of the eighteenth century
      which had originated there, and also a revival of opposition thereto on
      the side of realism. It led into speculative extremes, which finally
      sobered down, because of the meaningless scholastic phrases often
      introduced, and thus broke a path for the subsequent enthusiasm in behalf
      of French positivism in medicine. Those who constituted this school were,
      for the most part, men of importance, but were followed by a number of
      imbecile representatives. Use was made of the abstract doctrine of the
      philosophy of identity and the imponderables, such as electricity,
      mechanical forces, and magnetism, contrasted with which were the
      dimensions of matter and certain qualities, like sensibility,
      irritability, etc. Perhaps the greatest influence of this teaching was in
      the department of embryology and physiology, where Johannes Müller
      displayed his remarkable activity. Among the most distinguished
      representatives of the natural-philosophy school was Oken (1779-1851), of
      Bavaria, who subsequently taught in Munich, Jena, and Zürich, and
      published a large work on natural history, which did much for the
      popularization of this science; he explained that the skull is made up
      from a series of vertebræ; also discovered the Wolffian bodies, and was
      such a power in his way that Agassiz characterized him not only as "a
      master in the art of teaching," but as "a courageous and ruling spirit."
      Others of this school were: von Walther (1782-1849), eminent as a surgeon;
      Dollinger (1770-1841), of Bamberg, the distinguished leader of the Old
      Catholics; Reil and Procliaska, anatomists; Troxler and Schelling,
      philosophers and anatomists; Treviranus, the microscopist; Malfatti,
      Kilian, Spindler; Schmidt, of Vienna; and others too numerous to mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a successor to the School of Natural Philosophy came the School of
      Natural History (1831-1850). which made important concessions to realism;
      its most prominent members were from South Germany. This school was based<span
      class="pagenum">250</span><a name="link250" id="link250"></a> partially
      upon the philosophy of Nature, and expired almost suddenly. One of its
      most eminent exponents was Krukenberg, whose therapeutic creed was that
      "Physicians should be filled with pious reverence toward Nature; the
      organism is a whole, and must be contemplated in this sense; medical art
      is, undoubtedly, capable of decisive action, but let us not mistake that
      in many cases its activity is quite superfluous, in very many null and
      inadequate, and in many injurious." This school was the expression of the
      turn medicine was compelled to take in order to escape the after-effects
      of the one-sided, ideal, systematizing tendency of the eighteenth century
      (whose final outcome was natural philosophy), and to square itself with
      the realism and positivism of the nineteenth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schonlein (1763-1874), of Bamberg, outlined a system that taught
      pathological and anatomical revelations as concrete expressions of the
      independent entity disease, whose relation to the organism is as that of a
      parasite sojourning temporarily in it; he also constructed a
      classification of diseases, something after the manner of the botanical
      classification of de Candolle. One of his best-known pupils was Canstadt
      (1807-1850), whose <i>Jahresbericht</i> has preserved his name. Siebert,
      of Jena, famous as a diagnostician, and Haeser, the medical historian,
      belonged to this school.
    </p>
    <p>
      An offshoot of the French school of pathological anatomy and diagnosis was
      the so-called New Vienna School, which aided the French system in
      obtaining high recognition in German medicine, and gained its first
      influence from the labors of Wünderlich (1815-1857); next to whom should
      be mentioned Baron von Rokitansky (1804-1878),&mdash;a Bohemian,&mdash;one
      of the most famous men in modern times, and who exercised a profound
      influence, even in foreign countries,&mdash;particularly in Italy and
      Russia. Von Rokitansky worked for a long time in miserable quarters in
      Vienna, but finally a magnificent building was<span class="pagenum">251</span><a
      name="link251" id="link251"></a> specially erected for him. He was loaded
      with honors, and took his seat in the Austrian House of Deputies. Two sons
      are well known in medicine to-day, and two more have achieved reputation
      as singers,&mdash;a circumstance which the father embodied in the <i>bon
      mot</i> that "two of his sons howled and two of them healed." He
      transplanted into Vienna the tendency of the earliest
      pathologico-anatomical school, which captivated all by its novelty and
      interest, and in the post-mortem room and the clinical-lecture room he
      converted medicine in Germany to the realism of the nineteenth century. He
      was, indeed, the Van Swieten of his time in his influence upon educational
      affairs. His works are distinguished by simplicity, clearness, and logical
      order. He performed more than thirty thousand autopsies; for fourteen
      years he studied the defects of the septum of the heart and the
      comparative anatomy of the uterus and genito-urinary organs, yet paid
      little attention to the microscope or to applied medicine. He was a
      pathologist, pure and simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend and co-laborer,&mdash;Skoda (1803-1881),&mdash;also a Bohemian,
      was little, if any, less famous. In 1839 he gave to the world his famous
      work on <i>Auscultation and Percussion</i>; in 1847 became professor at
      Prague, and was the first man to lecture in German. In spite of his
      bachelor peculiarities, his taciturnity, and his heedlessness, he was very
      popular, and left a fortune,&mdash;quite in contrast to Rokitansky, who
      died poor. His scientific merit was based upon the fact that he overthrew
      the specific and pathognomonic arrangement of sounds, as taught by the
      French, and substituted therefor a category, based upon the physical
      constitution and shape of organs and tissues. He endeavored to develop a
      strictly scientific system of physics out of the empirical French doctrine
      of physical signs, and in his work on <i>Physical Diagnosis</i> he
      displayed an independent spirit, though as one who had received his
      impulse from France. He was the first in Germany to insist upon the merits<span
      class="pagenum">252</span><a name="link252" id="link252"></a> of
      Avenbrugger, and was the leading diagnostician of his time of the new
      Vienna school. Skoda was the first for whom was created, in Vienna, a
      specialty after the French model,&mdash;that is, a special division for
      patients suffering from thoracic diseases. Great as he was, we must yet
      lay it up against him that through his influence,&mdash;first in Vienna
      and afterward throughout Germany,&mdash;practical medicine degenerated
      into simple diagnosis, and that, by his observations on the natural course
      of disease, undisturbed by therapeutics, he became the founder and
      exponent of expectant or nihilistic therapeutics,&mdash;the harbinger of a
      very cheerless period in the history of medicine.

      class="pagenum">253</span><a name="link253" id="link253"></a> of Skoda's
      more eminent colleagues deserve brief mention: Oppolzer (1808-1871) was
      singularly gifted in diagnosis, popular, a teacher of wide influence, and
      manifested in superlative degree the characteristics that constitute a
      great physician; he wrote little, but was for a long time Professor of
      Medicine at Prague. Von Hebra, the elder (1816-1880), worked a complete
      revolution in dermatology, and developed a classification based upon the
      pathological anatomy of the skin. He instituted a new and independent line
      of therapeutics as applied to this branch of our art, for which the
      medical world will ever hold him in grateful remembrance. Sigmund and
      Zeissel during the same period did much to clear up the problems of
      syphilis. To Czermak (1828-1873) and TUrck (1807-1868) we are indebted
      (practically) for the making a specialty of diseases of the nose and
      larynx; of like service to ophthalmology were Jàger, Jaxtthal, Arlt,
      Stellwag von Carion, Hasner, Mauthner, Fuchs, and von Reuss, while Gruber
      and Politzer did as much for diseases of the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      An indirect offshoot of the new Vienna school is the so-called
      "Physiological Medicine," founded by Eoser (1817-1888),<span
      class="pagenum">254</span><a name="link254" id="link254"></a> of Stuttgart
      (late Professor of Surgery in Marburg), seconded by Griesinger and
      Wunderlich. Their views were directed against the symptomatologists and
      idealists, and particularly against the School of Natural History, the
      claim being that physiology must include vital phenomena, while from the
      morbid portions of these phenomena the special science should be formed as
      an artificial, yet practical, division of knowledge. 'Wunderlich's book of
      therapeutics was for a long time the best guide in this direction,
      inasmuch as it left to individual thought and judgment&mdash;the
      Hippocratic method of investigation&mdash;the determination of value and
      demand. Another offshoot, that differs but little from this save in
      definition, is the "School of Rational Medicine," originated by Pfeufer
      (1806-1869) and Henle (1809-1855), and which, since 1841, has been
      represented by a special journal. While Wunderlich claimed pathology to be
      the physiology of the sick, Henle considered this questionable and made no
      distinction at all between the physiology of the healthy and that of the
      ill. The language of the followers of this school contrasted strongly with
      that emanating from other schools, and for a time was confident and
      ingeniously triumphant; nevertheless, it did not forget philosophical
      speculation, and Hegel may now be regarded as indirectly the godfather of
      rational medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vagaries of Paracelsus led indirectly, though positively, to the
      foundation of Homoeopathy, and likewise originated the doctrine that bears
      the name of Rademacher (1772-1849). It is curious that this
      pseudoparacelsic system should spring up alongside of the Vienna school,
      its teachings being the classification of diseases by their therapy,
      Rademacher's followers possessed three universal remedies,&mdash;"cubic
      niter (nitrate of sodium), copper, and iron,"&mdash;and also three primary
      diseases that must take their titles from the three universal medicaments.
      In spite of the admission that these diseases were unknown, it was boldly<span
      class="pagenum">255</span><a name="link255" id="link255"></a> asserted
      they were with certainty to be cured by the three chief remedies. The
      three primary diseases, "sodic nitrate, copper, and iron diseases," do not
      necessarily remain as such, as they may throw some organ "into a condition
      of sympathy, and thus it results that iron disease may express itself in
      the form of consumption, delirium tremens, etc., while a copper disease
      may appear as worms, paralysis, jaundice, etc." Besides universal diseases
      and universal remedies there were diseases of organs, to be diagnosed by
      the efficacy of organ remedies; thus, abdominal diseases must be relieved
      by corresponding "abdominal remedies," head diseases with "head remedies,"
      chest diseases with "chest remedies," etc. Also for each particular viscus
      there must be a special remedy. What is the most surprising about this
      absurd doctrine is that it found followers, some even quite capable in
      their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, too, reappeared the Hydrotherapeutic System&mdash;the great apostle
      of which was Priessnitz (1799-1852)&mdash;based upon gross views of
      humoral pathology, according to which a disease entity was to be expelled
      in the form of sweat, eruption, etc. Poultices, cold packs, and cold baths
      were the principal therapeutic measures. Winternitz has made hydrotherapy
      popular and, in a measure, effective in the management of certain
      maladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolph Virchow in 1858 instituted the doctrine or theory known as "Modern
      Vitalism," which, in fact, was borrowed from natural scientific medicine,
      and distinguished from the vitalism of the previous century in that it
      breaks up the old vital force, which was supposed to be either distributed
      throughout the entire body or located in a few organs, into an indefinite
      number of associate vital forces working harmoniously, and assigns to them
      all the final elementary principles without microscopic seat. "Every
      animal principle has a sum of vital unities, each of which bears all the
      characteristics of life. The characteristics and unity of life cannot be
      found in any determinate<span class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256"
      id="link256"></a> point of a higher organism,&mdash;e.g., in the brain,&mdash;but
      only in the definite, ever-recurring arrangement of each element present;
      hence it results that the composition of a large body amounts to a kind of
      social arrangement, in which each one of the movements of individual
      existence is dependent upon the others, but in such a way that each
      element has a special activity of its own, and that each, although it
      receives the impulse to its own activity from other parts, still itself
      performs its own functions." This is nothing but another way of expressing
      the cell-doctrine, to which many medical men are now committed, which
      means that all bodies are built up of cells and that each cell has a unity
      and a purpose of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1677 Sir Robert Hooke discovered plant-cells; later Schwann discovered
      animal cells and Robert Brown cell-nuclei; but it remained for Virchow to
      supply the gap which had risen between anatomical knowledge and medical
      theory; that is, to supply a "cellular pathology," since which time the
      cell has assumed the rôle which the fibre occupied in the theories of the
      seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Time alone can decide as to the
      ultimate validity of this theory, which has in certain circles been most
      enthusiastically received. One of its weakest aspects is, perhaps, that
      the so-called intercellular substance plays an uncertain and
      unsatisfactory part. An important feature in which the cellular pathology
      differs from other systems, and particularly from the old humoral
      pathology, is in the doctrine that the blood itself is not the proper and
      original cause of dyscrasiæ, and probably not the cause of continuous
      alteration of the tissues; that these dyscrasiæ arise because the blood is
      not an independent structure, but dependent upon the condition of the
      patient in consequence of its continuous conveyance of the noxious
      material from all parts of the body,&mdash;the blood is, therefore, merely
      the medium for the production of the dyscrasia. This theory has made
      several peculiar, new, and symptomatic or morphological<span
      class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257" id="link257"></a> forms of
      disease, such as leukæmia, leucocytosis, etc. Virchow also cleared up the
      old and obscure ideas regarding pyæmia, and proved that an absorption of
      pus into the blood, which the name implies, is quite impossible; likewise,
      that pyæmia is inseparable from thrombotic processes.

      Virchow was born in Pomerania in 1821, and in 1849, he distinguished
      himself by attaining the highest grade in the career of the learned,&mdash;a
      professorship, which he first held in Würzburg. During earlier years his
      residence and labors were largely the result of necessities arising from
      political views, for on account of these he was long denied a residence in
      Berlin. A personal friend, now old, once an <i>interne</i> in the great
      Julius Spital, in Würzburg, at the time<span class="pagenum">258</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a> when Virchow taught there, tells me a
      light was burning every night in Virchow's room until 3 a.m., and yet the
      professor was always out at work by 7. It was by such intense application
      that he arrived at his present position at the very top of the
      professional ladder; but very few men have the physique and constitution
      to stand such arduous study. In 1856 he assumed the chair of Pathological
      Anatomy in Berlin, and introduced microscopical anatomy, to which
      Rokitansky had not given sufficient attention. Virchow was a former pupil
      of Johannes Muller, famous as a physiologist and pathologist, and his
      views to-day are often tinged by the doctrines acquired from this great
      teacher. He is also a great admirer of Harvey, whose picture, at least for
      a long time, was the only one permitted to hang in his study. His first
      edition of <i>Cellular Pathology</i> appeared in 1858; the colossal work
      on <i>Tumors</i> in 1866, in which he carried out the division of morbid
      growths originally adopted by Johannes Müller in 1838, classifying them
      according to their microscopical elements. He is also scarcely more
      celebrated for his teachings and labors than for the number of famous
      pupils brought up under his influence, among whom may be mentioned Leyden,
      Recklinghausen, Cohnheim, Waldeyer, Kuhne, and Rindfieisch. As a result of
      his labors has arisen in Germany what has been called the "Medical School
      of Natural Sciences," that seeks, by means of pathological anatomy and
      microscopy, experimental physiology and pathology, and the other applied
      methods, to make of medicine an exact science; and to it belong such men
      as Zienissen, Gerhardt, Notlniagel, Liebermeis-ter, Senator, Erb, Vogel,
      and others. An offshoot from this is the so-called "Munich Clinical
      School," to which belong von Buhl, Pettonkofer, Seitz, and Oertel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The splitting up of medicine into specialties, and the increase of its
      subordinate branches into schools.&mdash;so called,&mdash;resulted in
      great danger to the unity of medical science.

      to the methods which combine science and practice&mdash;the so-called
      clinical-practical method&mdash;is again sought by men who have
      established the well-known <i>Zeitschrift fur Klinische Medicin</i>, under
      the management of Frerichs and Leyden,&mdash;a journal which has already
      done a great deal of good.

      The versatile Bouchut, of Paris, has recently published a theory,&mdash;the
      so-called "Seminalism,"&mdash;for which the claim is made that he grants
      nothing to hypothesis, and everything to observation; its characteristic
      is that this new theory is also vitalistic,&mdash;in fact, the French have
      scarcely ever brought forth any other than vitalistic theories. Borden and
      Barthez, during the previous century, created the first French theory,
      which was followed out by Bichat, and later by Bouchut, who, as a matter
      of fact, owes much to Bichat. Bouchut teaches that beasts have an
      intelligence of instinct, and men one of abstraction; no beast oversteps
      the limits of animal thought, which is separated by an abyss from the
      productive thought of men; there is a proper kingdom of man, in accordance
      with his special nature; also, that the vital forces of men and of beasts
      are entirely different from each other, and that the principle of physical
      identity remains in the bodies of each, since the constantly renewed mass
      is formed in exact accordance with the original plans; in all the changes
      of his elements man is identical with man; all internal and external
      causes of disease modify, more or less, the vital force and its
      impressibility in the fluids or at some point in the economy, either
      increasing it or diminishing it. This theory, published in. 1873, claimed
      "in the abstraction of its promise and completeness of its conclusions to
      yield to none of its predecessors." Yet, even in France, the task of
      transforming medicine into a natural and exact science is far from being a
      <i>fait accompli</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most recent theories of disease are the result of microscopical study
      of germs,&mdash;the germ-theory, in fact,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum">260</span><a
      name="link260" id="link260"></a> stand in the closest possible relation
      with the doctrine of spontaneous generation, fermentation, miasm, and
      contagion. In 1838 Ehrenberg regarded infusoria as animals, but Dujardin
      in 1841 expressed doubts, and Perty in 1852 affirmed that most forms
      classified as infusoria should be assigned to the vegetable kingdom,
      where, a little later, Naegeli relegated them. The correctness of this
      conclusion was proved by Cohn, who also perfected a classification. This
      particular form of investigation began in the twenties of the present
      century and assumed its present direction in the thirties and forties.
      Gaspard, in 1823, renewed the experiments of Haller, and injected into the
      veins of animals, not alone putrescent material, but the blood of other
      creatures suffering from the effect of such injections. Bassi, in 1835,
      discovered the cause of silk-worm disease, thereby giving special impulse
      to the theory of parasitism, and this was quickly followed by evidence of
      the existence of both vegetable and animal exciters of disease.
      Schoenlein, in 1839, demonstrated the fungus of favus; Vogel discovered
      the Oïdium albicans in 1840; Goodsir, the <i>Sarcina ventriculi</i>, in
      1841; but the greatest influence upon the development of the parasitic, or
      germ-theory was the sequel to the discovery of the anthrax bacillus, by
      Davaine in 1850. In 1837 Latour and Schwann demonstrated that the cells,
      which were known even to Leeuwenhoeck, were actually vegetable forms, and
      Schulze had already pointed out that fermentation of fluids could only
      occur in the presence of extremely minute vegetable organisms; Chevreuil
      next showed that animal solids remained free from decomposition when
      protected from the access of germs; and in 1857 Pasteur demonstrated that
      fermentation and putrefaction were caused, not by chemical forms, as
      Liebig had taught, but simply by the agency of lower organisms, which he
      divided into aerobes and anaerobes; while in 1868 Chauveau queried as to
      whether morbific elements resided in the formed elements of germs or in
      their fluid<span class="pagenum">261</span><a name="link261" id="link261"></a>
      constituents. Thus the theory of <i>contagium vivum</i>, for which Henle
      contended as early as 1821, was not forgotten. In Germany Klebs and Hueter
      became the prominent champions of this theory; Hallier had designated his
      so-called "Microsporon septicum," and introduced a method of fractional
      cultures. The views of Klebs were opposed by Billroth, who contended for
      his "phlogistic ferment" and "<i>Coccobacteria septica</i>," upon which he
      wrote an elaborate and extensively illustrated treatise; he also at that
      time opposed the specific character of the lower organisms as disease
      agents. Hallier's <i>microsporon</i> was refuted by Cohn, who studied and
      classified the various fungi, and distinguished between the pathogenic and
      the septicogenic,&mdash;that is, those which produced disease and those
      which produced ordinary putrefaction. Then came the experimental evidence
      of Davaine and Koch, who demonstrated the development of bacteria from
      spores. It is hardly necessary to discuss this theory further, but I may
      mention the labors of Panum and of Brieger, who deeply investigated the
      poisons produced by bacteria, to which are given the general titles of
      ptomaines and toxins.
    </p>

      It would be unjust, however, did I not mention the name of Lister in
      connection with the inestimable benefit that has accrued to surgery from
      the practical application of the theory of infection to wounds,&mdash;a
      measure that brought about an entire revolution in surgery and surgical
      technique, and an entire reversal of the statistics of operations; where
      thousands formerly died, thousands now live, their lives being indirectly
      due to the labors of this one man and his following.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will add that it is necessary to realize the difference between life and
      death to appreciate the changes that have been brought about during the
      last score of years. Much that in former years was unjustifiable has
      become both justifiable and feasible; to-day patients, as a matter of
      course, live after operations which, so recently as when I was<span
      class="pagenum">262</span><a name="link262" id="link262"></a> a student,
      were considered impossible, or if performed exposed the operator to the
      charge of manslaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have spoken of the impulse which came from Avenbrugger's invention of
      percussion, which was greatly extended through the translation of his work
      by Corvisart (1755-1821); the latter also excelled as a clinical teacher
      and pathological anatomist, and had much to do with the education of
      others of his <i>confrères</i> whose names are lustrous in history. Among
      the most celebrated was Laënnec (1781-1826), who, though brought up among
      most trying surroundings, early manifested a zeal for medicine. He became
      a field-surgeon in the French army soon after the Reign of Terror, and
      pushed his classical and medical studies with restless zeal. In 1815 his
      first experiments were made with the stethoscope, the invention of which
      was due to accident: in order to hear the sounds of the heart more
      clearly, lie one day applied a cylindrical roll of paper, and then
      immediately constructed the whole form of the stethoscope upon the
      principle now everywhere resorted to. In 1819 he published his work on
      Mediate Auscultation,&mdash;a treatise on prognosis in disease of the
      lungs and heart, based principally upon this new aid to investigation. The
      treatise was speedily translated into all the languages of Europe. After
      enjoying a large practice Laënnec succumbed to ill health at the early age
      of forty-five. He seems to have had but slight appreciation of his own
      services to medicine, and to have prided himself rather on his skill in
      riding horseback. Honor and fame, however, followed closely upon the
      publication of his well-known work, and the manuals of physical diagnosis
      which now find frequent mention in book catalogues, and come from various
      and wide sources are the legitimate outcome of Avenbrugger's and of
      Laënncc's pioneer treatises.
    </p>
    <p>
      A versatile French writer who devoted especial attention to medical
      nomenclature was Piorry (1794-1879), to whom we are<span class="pagenum">263</span><a
      name="link263" id="link263"></a> indebted for the pleximeter. The double
      stethoscope, a legitimate extension of Laënnec's simple instrument, was
      invented by Cammann, of New York, and can justly be claimed for American
      medicine. Other methods of physical examination&mdash;like spirometry,
      chest measurement, and study of expired air&mdash;have been introduced
      since 1846. The ophthalmoscope, which has been of such sterling service,
      and is based upon the simplest of principles, was the invention of the
      famous Helmholtz, but just deceased. The principle of endoscopy,&mdash;the
      illumination and visual examination of the various cavities of the human
      body,&mdash;the various specula, the spectroscope, the sphygmograph, the
      more accurate record of physical sounds, the application of electricity,
      and the employment of thermometry represent a few of the strides in the
      medical science of the present century, thereby aiding and perfecting the
      art of diagnosis, which, in turn, must ever necessarily form the basis for
      all rational treatment. Let no one complain that we are still so far from
      certainty in every case; the wonder is that so much has been discovered in
      so short a space of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wonderful as have been these advances, the greatest achievements have
      accrued to the department of surgery, which Chamisso terms "the <i>seeing</i>
      portion of the healing art." The sixteenth century opened the way for
      checking of haemorrhages; the seventeenth accomplished great
      simplifications and improvement in the way of dressing wounds; the
      eighteenth gave a refining and elevating tendency to the study of applied
      practice, and raised surgery to a level with other branches of science;
      and now the nineteenth century has, toward its close, made surgery as
      nearly, perhaps, as it ever can be, an exact science, to which every other
      branch of science has been made contributory. The chain-saw, invented in
      1806 by Jeffery, alone gave an impetus to resection, which was cultivated
      especially in Germany; to resection was added osteotomy by Heine<span
      class="pagenum">264</span><a name="link264" id="link264"></a> and Maver;
      this, in turn, was succeeded by the so-called subcutaneous osteotomy of
      Langenbeck in 1854; Stromeyer introduced subcutaneous tenotomy in 1831,
      which was a very pronounced advance on all that had gone before; then came
      the introduction of anæsthesia, by which were made possible operations
      that had been beyond human endurance; by the introduction of the rubber
      bandage by Esmarch in 1873 bloodless methods were made possible. Pain and
      haemorrhage, the two greatest enemies of the conscientious surgeon, being
      thus almost annihilated, there was left but an apparently theoretical
      limit to what the surgeon might accomplish. Orthopaedic surgery,
      introduced by Delpech, was unknown prior to 1816; it was first practiced
      systematically by Stromeyer and popularized in France by Guerin.
      Operations on nerves were studied as special methods by Schuh, Wernher,
      and Nussbaum. Jobert and Simon abroad, and Sims and Emmet in the United
      States, by their studies of fistulæ peculiar to the genito-urinary tract
      in females, have conferred inestimable benefits upon suffering womanhood.
      So late as 1839 Vidal declared there did not exist in the history of
      surgery a single well-authenticated case of complete cure of vesicovaginal
      tear.

      It is not my intention to more than barely refer to the living surgeons of
      to-day, or those who have but very recently passed away from us; but it
      would be an injustice to overlook Bernhard von Langenbeck and Theodor
      Billroth. The former, born in 1810 and deceased in 1887, was for a time a
      teacher of physiology, but subsequently became successor of Dieffenbach in
      the University of Berlin. The influence he exerted upon surgery in Germany
      and (since the decline of French precedence) upon surgery all over the
      world, has perhaps been greater than that of any one man since Dupuytren's
      time. He it was that introduced into surgical technique and surgical
      pathology the experimental method of which Johannes Müller was the great<span
      class="pagenum">265</span><a name="link265" id="link265"></a> exponent;
      indeed, the relatively high importance which pathology is given to-day in
      every surgical curriculum is due more to his labors than to those of any
      other one man. Genial, learned, indefatigable, he was the ideal
      accomplished teacher. It would be impossible in any short <i>résumé</i> of
      his life and labors to do justice to so distinguished a man, to whom the
      profession owes so much. Perhaps the highest testimonial that could be
      given would be the enumeration of the men who were ever and always his
      enthusiastic admirers. Langenbeck was the founder of the German Congress
      of Surgeons, and for many years its president, and the permanent home this
      association has built for itself in Berlin bears his name; the surgical
      journal he founded has now passed its fiftieth volume, and is today the
      first periodical of its class in any country or language.

      Theodor Billroth, who only within a few years joined the great silent
      majority, was for many years the surgical sun of Austro-Hungary, around
      whom revolved all the other lights of the profession in the empire. He was
      as expert with the microscope as with the knife, and equally great with
      both. Although his great and elaborate work on <i>Coccobacteria Septica</i>
      is now obsolete, it nevertheless marked an era in surgical pathology, as
      does also his textbook on the same subject, which reached fifteen editions
      and has been widely translated. He it was who made the first resection of
      the larynx and of the stomach, and to him we are indebted for many other
      daring operations. It was the fame of this teacher that in recent years
      led young Americans to Vienna, and he set the example in every way for a
      constantly growing number of students whose names are, or ere long will
      be, famous. Billroth was born, in 1819,<span class="pagenum">267</span><a
      name="link267" id="link267"></a> in Bergen, and succeeded Schuh in Vienna,
      after having taught most acceptably at Zürich. What he was to his teacher,
      Langenbeck, such are the younger German surgeons, like Czerny,
      Gussenbauer, Mikulicz, and others, to <i>him</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here may be recalled the pride with which Americans greet the name of
      McDowell, who performed the first ovariotomy, and prepared the way for a
      branch of abdominal surgery the results of which have fairly astonished
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much to be said also for certain measures, such as the
      introduction into surgery of plaster of Paris, by Larrey; of starched
      bandages, by Seutin; of absorbable material for ligatures and sutures, the
      latter from animal sources. Finally, antiseptic&mdash;or, better, aseptic&mdash;methods
      of operating and caring for injuries and wounds have worked a revolution
      in methods and results that is, perhaps, the most important known to
      medical history.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the present century the French appeared to lead in
      matters surgical, and were distinguished by dexterity in operating,
      fertility of invention, accuracy of observation, and clearness of clinical
      teaching. The foundation of this reputation was laid by Desault, and upon
      it his successors continued to build. From his school descended the
      barber-surgeon Boyer (1757-1833), who became the first surgeon and trusted
      adviser of Napoleon, and was by him created a baron. He was the author of
      a work, in eleven volumes, which has survived many editions and
      translations, and therein he laid especial stress upon after-treatment.
      Richerand (1779-1840), like Boyer, was made a baron, and was a professor
      in Paris; but his character suffered from his overweening ambition and
      vanity; he was wont to exhibit most unpleasant personal traits;
      nevertheless his surgical ability entitles him to front rank among his
      contemporaries. The third surgeon honored with the rank of baron was
      Larrey (1766-1842), surgeonin-chief<span class="pagenum">268</span><a
      name="link268" id="link268"></a> to the Grand Army, and whom Napoleon I
      called the most virtuous of men. In 1792 he joined the Army of the Rhine,
      and was the physician of the so-called "flying ambulance" for twenty-two
      years. He was present in sixty great battles (including that of Waterloo)
      and four hundred engagements, and was three times wounded. His memoirs and
      monographs on subjects connected with military surgery cause him to be
      often quoted even at the present day. It is recorded that he performed two
      hundred amputations in a single dav; during the march through Russia he
      had at one time in Smolensk ten thousand men to care for in one hospital.
      A wonderful organizer, he was idolized by the soldiers, and seems to have
      been held in nearly the same esteem as his great prototype. Ambroise Paré.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most famous French surgeon of this century,&mdash;equally celebrated
      as a diagnostician, as an operator, and as a teacher,&mdash;was Baron
      Dupuytren (1777-1835). As a child he had been stolen, on account of his
      eminent beauty. His early life was one of poverty and want. He zealously
      devoted himself to anatomy and physiology as foundations for successful
      work in surgery and ultimately secured a private practice that embraced
      all France, and, when visiting other countries, was received like a
      prince. For years he devoted three hours daily to didactic lectures. He
      died, leaving a fortune of several millions of francs; he even offered to
      the exiled Charles of England a million francs as a trifling recompense
      for his misfortune. He was known as "The Xapoleon of Surgery,"&mdash;a
      title well earned, yet one which drew upon him the enmity of many of his
      contemporaries, particularly as he seemed inclined to persecute all who
      dared to tread in his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      His death resulted from empyema, for which he declined operation,
      preferring, as he said, "to die at the hands of God, rather than man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The first truly scientific practitioner of orthopædic surgery in France
      was Delpech (1777-1832). of Toulouse, who<span class="pagenum">269</span><a
      name="link269" id="link269"></a> was likewise the pioneer in subcutaneous
      tenotomy of the tendo Achillis and in autoplastic operations. At his own
      expense he erected a large orthopaedic institute in Montpellier, and his
      death occurred while on his way to pay a visit to this institution, both
      he and his coachman being shot by an insane patient upon whom he had
      operated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dupuytren's successor in the Hôtel-Dieu was Roux (1780-1854), who earned
      specific reputation as a dextrous and rapid operator; his labors in
      constructive and plastic surgery were extraordinary. The first to apply
      physical investigation to surgery was Lisfranc (1790-1847),&mdash;best
      remembered, perhaps, in connection with amputation of the foot. Marjolin
      (1770-1850) was a teacher of eminence, as were also Sanson (1790-1841) and
      Cloquet (1790-1883), though the latter is better remembered for his works
      on anatomy than for his exploits in surgery. Civialc (1792-1867) is
      chiefly famous for revamping the operation of lithotrity, for, though a
      lithotrite had been invented by d'Etoilles, Civiale was the first actual
      operator, for which he was fiercely opposed by Larrey, Sanson, Velpeau,
      and others; he lived to see his rivals confounded and lithotrity accepted
      as a legitimate surgical procedure. Amussat (1796-1856) reinvented torsion
      of arteries for the repression of haemorrhage, for, although this measure
      had been suggested by the ancients, it was held to be suitable only for
      very small vessels; he never held a professorship, yet at his residence
      were gathered so-called "conferences" that were attended by the most
      eminent medical men of the time; he is specially known in connection with
      the operation for opening the colon in the lumbar region. Pravaz was a
      surgeon of Lyons, whose name has been perpetuated by the small syringe&mdash;the
      original hypodermatic&mdash;which he devised. Vidal (1803-1856), of
      Cassis, made a reputation by his work on <i>Surgery</i>, in five volumes,
      which was extensively translated and reprinted throughout Europe. Jobert
      de Lamballe<span class="pagenum">270</span><a name="link270" id="link270"></a>
      (1799-1867) rose from abject poverty to a professorship and a seat in the
      Académie; he is particularly remembered for his achievements in plastic
      operations. Velpeau (1795-1868) in 1834 became the successor of Boyer;
      popular as a teacher, and an author of great fertility, he devoted
      attention alike to surgery and midwifery; his <i>Operative Surgery</i>, in
      three volumes, and a treatise on <i>Diseases of the Mammary Gland</i> are
      still classics. Gerdy (1797-1856), like Velpeau, was the son of
      poverty-stricken parents; in 1833 he became a professor, and wrote
      extensively on bandages, dressings, and on operation for the radical cure
      of hernia. Bonnet (1802-1858) rendered great service to surgery by his
      researches upon diseases of the joints. Malgaigne (1806-1865), made
      Professor of Operative Surgery in Paris in 1865, devoted great attention
      to surgical anatomy, operative and experimental surgery, and especially to
      fractures and dislocations,&mdash;his work on fractures is met with on
      many book-shelves to-day. Nélaton (1807-1874) was surgeon to Emperor
      Napoleon III, and, though he wrote little, became peculiarly eminent as a
      practitioner; his ingenious probe, tipped with porcelain, by means of
      which he located a bullet in the foot of Garibaldi, is well known. He
      devoted special attention to tuberculosis of bones and joints, being,
      perhaps, further instigated thereto by the case of the Prince Imperial;
      his treatise on this subject forms most acceptable reading to-day, and he
      taught the existence of osseous tuberculosis long before such was
      recognized in either Great Britain, Germany, or the United States.

      Were I to refer to living contemporaries of many of the celebrities just
      mentioned, I should speak with special reverence and esteem of Péan,
      Verneuil, and Oilier, who are to-day the greatest surgeons in France; but
      with their lives and labors any one may easily acquaint himself from
      sources which are at the command of all.

      any very decided impression upon surgery, although there are many most
      excellent practitioners of the art in Italy; the best known are Porta
      (1800-1875), Vanzetta (born in 1809), and Rizzoli (who died in 1880);
      lliberi, Tizzoni, Loreta, Durante, and others are, perhaps, equally
      entitled to mention.

      Since the time of Gimbernat there have been no surgeons in Spain whose
      services have been sufficiently important to rouse special attention away
      from their native peninsula. The Spaniards are well educated, and well
      equipped for practice, but do not appear as great originators nor
      experimenters; doubtless because their medical schools and universities
      long since lost prestige, owing to clerical and Inquisitorial
      interference; nevertheless, Spanish medical literature has kept well
      abreast with that of other countries.

      In Great Britain the example of John Hunter, during the eighteenth
      century, produced results of the greatest importance; advances were made
      simultaneously in physiology and pathology which the Anglo-Saxon races
      have been quick to utilize. While, perhaps, more conservative and less
      inventive than the French, the surgeons of England have ever been in the
      front rank, and quite early they gave great attention to careful local
      dietetic and hygienic measures, of which Continental surgeons were, and
      are, too often neglectful. English surgeons, too, while they have been
      specialists, have never been quite so narrow in their respective fields as
      the Continental surgeons, and it has always been rare to find one who was
      not also a good general practitioner; the immense advantages which this
      added knowledge confers must be apparent. The most celebrated
      representative of British surgery of this century was the son of a
      clergyman,&mdash;Sir Astley Cooper, born in Norfolk in 1748, but
      subsequently a resident of London. During youth he resolutely compressed
      the bleeding limb of a playmate who was the victim of an accident, so that
      time was gained for the arrival of a surgeon, who then tied the vessel;
      this decided his future calling, and he pursued his studies in London,
      Edinburgh, and on the Continent. In 1791 he settled down to private
      practice, which soon yielded him an income in excess of £20,000
      ($100,000), for his day the equivalent of thrice that amount at present.
      At the age of seventy-three he succumbed to a longstanding asthma. He was
      a somewhat voluminous writer, and his works on fractures, dislocations,
      and diseases of the breast are by no means obsolete. His motto was: "First
      observe, and then think." Exceptionally endowed with all the graces of
      person, he became one of the most popular and influential men of his day;
      withal, he was always zealous for his profession, never unoccupied, and
      charitable to a high degree. Of his boldness we have evidence in the fact
      that in 1817 he tied the abdominal aorta, being the first to undertake
      this surgical feat.

      A colleague of Cooper's at St. Thomas's Hospital was Travers, already
      spoken of in connection with irritation. Tyrrel, a nephew of Cooper, was a
      well-known surgeon, particularly in diseases of the eye. Others of the
      same name were: Samuel Cooper (1781-1848), who wrote a voluminous treatise
      on practical surgery; Bransby Cooper (1792-1853), Sir Astley's nephew and
      adopted son, who was well known, and who achieved an eminence that is only
      dimmed by that of his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Benjamin Brodie (1783-1862) was distinguished as a special
      investigator and a soft-tissue operator, of whom it is said that, basing
      his actions upon his statistics, the older he became, the less frequently
      he operated. His bestknown writings concern diseases of the joints.
      Guthrie (1785-1856), a man of noble characteristics, was the friend and<span
      class="pagenum">274</span><a name="link274" id="link274"></a> companion of
      Wellington, whom he accompanied in all his campaigns. Although well known
      as a lithotomist, his fame rests chiefly upon studies and writings in the
      domain of military surgery. A colleague of his in the Westminster
      Hospital, Sir William Lawrence (1783-1867), was surgeon to the queen,
      highly esteemed as a dextrous operator, and an authority on ruptures and
      on operative surgery. John Lizars (1783-1861) was a pupil of John Bell,
      and distinguished himself as a bold operator and fertile writer; early in
      the century he treated chronic hydrocephalus by operation. Robert Liston
      (1794-1847) was another remarkable surgeon and a wonderful operator. Sir
      Charles Bell (1774-1842) has already been mentioned for his researches on
      the nerves, and he also wrote on operative surgery, and is somewhat famed
      for his opposition to venesection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Edinburgh James Syme (1799-1870) secured great reputation both by his
      dexterity as an operator&mdash;which is spoken of by his own pupils as
      marvelous&mdash;and by his introduction of resection into general
      practice. Sir James Y. Simpson (1811-1870) aided to make the Edinburgh
      school famous by his researches into the domain of both surgery and
      obstetrics. Though the inventor of acupressure, his name will forever be
      associated with the introduction of chloroform. Professor Dunn says that,
      u after seeing the terrible agony of a poor Highland woman under
      amputation of the breast, Simpson left the class-room and went straight to
      Parliament House to seek work as a solicitor's clerk. But on second
      thought he returned to the study of medicine, asking: 'Can anything be
      done to make operations less painful?' The ultimate result was the
      discovery of chloroform, and so the suffering of one became the occasion
      of the deliverance of many. Upon his advocacy of chloroform in obstetrics
      he had to defend himself against most vehement attacks of both Scotch and
      English clergymen, who affected to regard such procedure as a crime that
      transgressed the will of the Deity; but he successfully confounded<span
      class="pagenum">275</span><a name="link275" id="link275"></a> these
      assailants with their own weapons, proving himself their more than equal
      in knowledge of Scripture lore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other British surgeons, living and dead, deserve most honorable
      mention, but time and space will not permit. I cannot, however, pass by
      without mentioning Curling, Annandale, Chiene, Cheyne, Macewen, Ogston,
      Jonathan Hutchinson, Sir James Paget, Christopher Heath, Thomas Langmore,
      Savory, Holden, Holmes, Adams, Sir Joseph Lister, and Sir Prescott Hewitt,
      of the value of whose labors I have already tried to speak; Sir William
      Ferguson, of whom it is said that he had the eagle's eye, a lion's heart,
      and a lady's hand; John Bowman, best known for his work in ophthalmic
      surgery; Sir Henry Thompson, the eminent lithotomist and lithotritist; and
      Sir Spencer Wells, Keith, Lawson Tait, and Bantock, whose names are
      inseparable from the history of abdominal surgery. And what can be said of
      the young men who are being trained in the methods and practice of their
      predecessors&mdash;trained not only in the direction of manual dexterity,
      but in experimental science, to which they make the former subservient'?
      All honor to these scions of Great Britain's surgical art, who have
      astonished the world with their consummate ability! I would that time
      permitted recapitulation of the work accomplished in late years by the
      present generation of men in London, Edinburgh, and other medical centres;
      but the scope of these chapters does not cover this ground.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he<span
      class="pagenum">276</span><a name="link276" id="link276"></a> history of
      medicine in America commences with the early struggles of the physicians
      in the American colonies. One Dr. Wootton came to Virginia in 1607 as
      Surgeon-General of the London Company. The following year Dr. Russell was
      with Captain Smith in his exploration of Chesapeake Bay. Neither of these
      men stayed long in the country, since, in 1609, Captain Smith, after being
      wounded, was compelled to return to England for treatment, for lack of
      medical aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, in 1626. Peter Minuit <i>purchased the island of Manhattan for the
      sum of twenty-four dollars</i>, there was probably no physician there at
      the time. Undoubtedly the first physician, in what is now New York, was
      Lamontagne,&mdash;a Huguenot, who arrived in 1637, and who seems to have
      been a man of great capability for his time. It would appear that men of
      no little eminence left the Old World for the New during the early days of
      the American colonies, and that the medical services which the early
      colonists received were on a par with those received by those whom they
      left behind in their old homes. During the seventeenth century a number of
      reputable physicians emigrated to this country, among them Dr. John Clark,
      of Boston, in 1638, whose son and grandson followed him in his profession
      and became prominent in their chosen calling. In 1644 came Dr. Child, a
      graduate of Padua, who seems to have been a man of great learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of younger Americans also went abroad to<span class="pagenum">277</span><a
      name="link277" id="link277"></a> study,&mdash;Leyden, Paris, Padua, and
      the British universities being those most eagerly sought. In Virginia, so
      early as 1619, the Colonial Assembly discussed the erection of a
      university or college. In 1637 a public college was established in
      Cambridge, and in 1638 the Rev. John Harvard left to it his library and
      half his fortune, after which it was called Harvard College. William and
      Mary College was chartered in Virginia in 1693. Probably the first
      lectures in anatomy given in this countrv were those of Giles Firman,
      which were given previous to 1647 at Harvard College.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this early day that arose the custom, continued until very
      recently, of studying medicine with a preceptor. This was necessary at
      that time, and until comparatively recently, because of the scarcity of
      institutions of learning and the expense connected with an education. The
      form of apprenticeship was often gone through with for a term of years
      varying from three to seven, during which time the young student performed
      the most menial duties, had very meagre opportunity for anatomical study,
      and acquired his knowledge rather by contact with and absorption from his
      preceptor than in any other way. In this method of teaching the personal
      element was so pronounced that everything, in fact, depended upon the
      preceptor, save what natural talent and industry might accomplish, With
      such meagre opportunities the means for doing were equally scant.
      Nevertheless, emergency made many of these early American practitioners
      self-reliant and competent to treat, according to the knowledge of that
      day, the various accidents then so common. In 1636 the Assembly of
      Virginia passed a fee-bill for surgeons and apothecaries, fees, however,
      being often paid in tobacco, powder, lead, wampum, etc. Not a few combined
      ministry of the body and the soul, and a number of eminent physicians were
      also preachers of more or less renown,&mdash;among them John Rogers, John
      Fisk, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably<span class="pagenum">278</span><a name="link278" id="link278"></a>
      the only medical work published in America during the seventeenth century
      was <i>A Brief Rule to Guide the Common People of New England how to Treat
      Them-selves and Others in the Small-pocks or Measels</i>. This was printed
      and sold in 1677, by John Foster, of Boston. It was printed upon one side
      of a single sheet in double columns, and described both of these diseases
      as due to the blood endeavoring to recover a new form and state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old English distinction between physician and surgeon was for many
      years quite generally preserved, but could not persist, because of the
      different conditions under which men practiced. During this century, also,
      a number of midwives made excellent practitioners,&mdash;among them the
      wife of Dr. Fuller, one of the <i>May Flower</i> pilgrims. Those colonial
      days, however, seem to have been free from the ravages of itinerant
      specialists and charlatans, who so abundantly infested Europe at the time.
      It is also to the everlasting credit of the American profession that it
      took no part in the horrible delusions and scandalous transactions
      connected with the Salem witchcraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the beginning of the eighteenth century the population of the United
      States was about three hundred thousand whites; by the end of the century
      it had increased to a total of about four millions. During this century a
      larger proportion of educated medical men came from abroad and settled in
      various parts of the country, while the Colonial and the Revolutionary
      Wars offered ample opportunity for the development and study of military
      medicine and surgery. Commerce between the two continents increased;
      communication became more free, and the people of the Old World and the
      New were constantly brought into closer relation. The most lively medical
      controversy of the century was, probably, that excited over the
      introduction of vaccination against small-pox. In previous sketches I have
      had to intimate that the greatest enemy of the medical profession in time
      past has been the clergy. In this<span class="pagenum">279</span><a
      name="link279" id="link279"></a> particular instance, however, it was to
      the Rev. Cotton Mather, of Boston, that the profession is largely indebted
      for the favor with which the new method was received in this country. In
      1721 he called the attention of various American physicians to the method,
      then in vogue in Turkey, of inoculation with virus from the active
      disease. Dr. Boylston, of Brookline, Mass., who settled in Boston,
      corresponded with members of the British Royal Society and finally
      determined to put the method to actual proof. In 1721 he inoculated his
      own son with the virus of natural small-pox, and within the next year had
      inoculated two hundred and forty-seven persons, of whom about two per
      cent, died of the disease; while, of nearly six thousand persons attacked
      by the disease in the natural way, more than fourteen per cent. died. In
      spite of this, the man and the method were violently attacked by the
      people and the profession, and found their warmest defenders among the
      ranks of the clergy. Benjamin Franklin, then only sixteen years of age,
      joined with the rabble in opposing the inoculation method. Boylston was
      threatened with hanging, and had even to hide himself for a time, he died
      in 1766.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the great discovery of Edward Jenner societies were formed for the
      promotion of vaccination all over the world. The earliest vaccination in
      the United States was performed by Dr. Waterhouse (born 1754, died 1846),
      who operated upon four of his own children in 1800.<span class="pagenum">280</span><a

      It was during the eighteenth century that a number of our best-known
      educational institutions were founded in the different colonies,&mdash;among
      them, Yale College, in 1701; Princeton (College of New Jersey), in 1746;
      University of Pennsylvania, in 1749; Columbia (King's College), in 1754;
      and others, only a little less known. In most of these latter were
      established medical departments, but the method of apprenticing students
      to physicians was still in general observance, no preliminary education
      whatever, as a rule, being demanded. In 1766, however, the New Jersey
      Medical Society ordained that no student be taken as an apprentice by any
      member of the society unless he had competent knowledge of Latin and some
      initiation in the Greek. About the middle of the century Drs. Bard and
      Middleton, in New York, and Dr. Cadwallader, in Philadelphia, began giving
      lectures in anatomy, while at Newport, Rhode Island, Dr. William Hunter,
      between 1754 and 1756,&mdash;a near relative of the famous Hunters of
      London, and a pupil of the elder Monro,&mdash;gave a course of lectures on
      human and comparative anatomy. Dr. William Shippen. Jr. (1736-1808),&mdash;a
      student of John Hunter's,&mdash;returned in 1762 to America, and gave his
      first course of lectures on anatomy and midwifery during the years
      immediately following. His lectures led to the formation of a Medical
      Department of the College of Philadelphia, in 1765, in which lectures were
      continued regularly until the winter of 1775, when the War of the
      Revolution interfered. In July of 1776 Shippen was made Chief-Physician of
      the Continental Army, and in the following year was elected by the
      Provincial Congress Director-in-General of army hospitals. During the
      latter years of the war he returned to Philadelphia each winter, and
      delivered a course of lectures, shortened by the necessities of the case.
      Thus he was the first public teacher of midwifery in this country. He was
      ably seconded in his work by Dr. John Morgan (1735-1789),&mdash;also a
      pupil of Hunter and Monro, who received a prominent army appointment in
      1775, but who, two years later, was unfortunately dismissed on charges
      subsequently proved false. Shippen and Morgan were for some time the only
      professors in the Medical Department of the College of Philadelphia. In
      1768 Kuhn&mdash;a pupil of Linnæus&mdash;was made Professor of Materia
      Medica and Botany; and Benjamin Bush, a year later, was given the Chair of
      Chemistry. The commencement of this institution occurred in 1768, when the
      degree of M.B. was given to seventeen graduates. In 1779 political reasons
      led to the abolition of the College of Philadelphia, the University of
      Pennsylvania taking its place. Ten years later the former institution was
      restored, and in 1791 the two institutions were united. The present
      Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania is, therefore, the
      legitimate continuation of the first medical school in America.<span

      The Medical Department of King's College, New York, now Columbia College,
      was organized in 1767, by Clossey, an Irishman; Middleton, a Scotchman;
      James Smith, a graduate of Leyden; Tenant, an alumnus of Princeton
      College; and Bard, who was by far the most eminent of the group, a
      Philadelphian by birth, who had studied under the best masters in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Medical Department of Harvard University was organized in 1783. Most
      prominent in connection with it was Dr. John Warren, the first teacher of
      anatomy and surgery, and the founder of a family of eminent medical men,
      whose descendant, Dr. J. Collins Warren, is to-day an occupant of the
      chair of surgery in the same school. The Medical Department of Dartmouth
      College was organized in 1798 by Dr. Nathan Smith,&mdash;a man of great
      energy and unusual versatility.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these medical colleges were developing their strength the medical
      profession were not idle, and institutions and libraries sprang up in
      various places. The Pennsylvania Hospital, for instance, founded in 1762,
      is to be credited with the oldest medical library in this country, many<span
      class="pagenum">283</span><a name="link283" id="link283"></a> of its
      volumes having been selected especially for it by Louis, of Paris, and the
      famous Lettsom, of London. It now contains nearly fifteen thousand
      volumes. The library of the New York Hospital, not quite so large, was
      founded in 1776; that of the College of Physicians, in Philadelphia, in
      1788. The profession of New Jersey organized the State Medical Society in
      1765. In 1781 was founded the Massachusetts Medical Society. In 1787 arose
      the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1789 the profession of Maryland organized the so-called Medical and
      Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland, constituting thereby the same
      organization as the societies of other States. Before the close of the
      century, Delaware, New Hampshire, and South Carolina had also organized
      societies. In the larger cities extensive hospitals were also founded,&mdash;the
      Pennsylvania Hospital, in Philadelphia, in 1751, inside of which the first
      clinical instruction in this country was given by Dr. Thomas Bond. The New
      York Hospital began in 1769, simultaneously with the organization of the
      Medical Department of King's College. The first insane-asylum in America
      was built at Williamsburgh, Va., in 1773, although the charter of the
      Pennsylvania Hospital, dated 1751, provided for the care of lunatics,
      though not at that time in a separate institution.<span class="pagenum">284</span><a

      The most conspicuous medical character of the century in American history
      was undoubtedly Benjamin Rush (1745-1813). He was one of Shippen's
      earliest students in anatomy, studied widely abroad, was a member of the
      Continental Congress, and one of the signers of the Declaration of
      Independence. After him is named Rush Medical College of Chicago. He was
      an extensive writer on a variety of subjects, not only professional, but
      political, philosophical, etc. He recognized but two kinds of remedies,&mdash;stimulants
      and depressants,&mdash;and held it to be the principal duty of the
      physician to decide as to which were most advisable in a given case. He
      called calomel the "Samson" of the materia medica, and his opponents
      contended that he was right, since it had undoubtedly slain its thousands.
      As an accurate observer of disease, he was correct and exact, and his
      descriptions are to-day both classic and reliable.

      The study of practical anatomy lias always been carried on in this country
      under great disadvantages. At first only the bodies of executed criminals
      were sparingly furnished.

      In 1788, in New York, occurred the celebrated "doctor's mob," which
      attested the vehemence of public objection to dissection, and which for
      two days defied the control of all the authorities. Secret dissections had
      been practiced in Harvard College so early as 1771, but the practice was
      against the law even for sixty years later in Massachusetts. Physiology,
      as such, was not taught in any medical school in this country during the
      century, and experimental<span class="pagenum">285</span><a name="link285"
      id="link285"></a> physiology was practically unknown. Surgery was eagerly
      studied, especially during war times, and Dr. John Jones (1729-1791), of
      the King's College School, was, perhaps, the most eminent of the surgeons
      of his day. Others who vied with him were William Shippen, Jr., the first
      teacher of surgery in the College of Philadelphia; John Warren, of Boston;
      Richard Bayley, of Connecticut; Baynham, of Virginia; and McKnight, of New
      York.

      The position of midwifery during the earlier years of the country may be,
      perhaps, understood by the following extract from the <i>New York Weekly
      Post-Boy</i>, of July, 1745:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last night died, in the prime of life, to the almost universal regret and
      sorrow of this city, Mr. John du Puy, M.D., man-midwife," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first practitioner of obstetrics in New England was Dr. Lloyd
      (1723-1810), a pupil of Hunter and Smelley; while Dr. Shippen, in
      Philadelphia, endeavored to organize a school for the instruction of
      midwives, in which, however, he met with insuperable difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first attempt to regulate practice in colonial times was an act passed
      by the General Assembly of 1760, providing for at least a form of
      examination in physic and surgery, registration, etc. The first medical
      journal to appear in the United States appeared about 1790. It was
      entitled <i>A Journal of the Practice of Medicine and Surgery and Pharmacy
      in the Military Hospitals of France</i>, consisting merely of translations
      from the French journals of military medicine. The first real American
      medical journal was the <i>Medical Repository</i>, begun in 1797 and
      discontinued in 1824.
    </p>

      The present century, now drawing to its close, saw in its earlier half the
      rise of a large number of American physicians and surgeons who have made
      their names illustrious for all time by their teachings, their writings,
      and their invention and originality. While it is, of course, invidious to<span

      names, the following certainly deserve honorable mention in this list,

      whose names must be omitted for want of space.

      John R. Cox (1773-1864), an early student of Benjamin Rush, filled the
      chair of Materia Medica and Pharmacy in the University of Pennsylvania,
      and published the <i>American Dispensatory</i> in 1806. Caspar Wistar
      (1761-1818) was the author of a <i>System of Anatomy</i>,&mdash;held in
      great favor in his day as a text-book. Nathaniel Chapman (1780-1853) was
      Professor of Theory and Practice in the University of Pennsylvania until
      1850. John Eberle held the similar chair of the Jefferson School from
      1825-1831. The former wrote on <i>Materia Medica and Therapeutics</i>, the
      latter on the <i>Practice of Medicine</i>, both works being exceedingly
      popular. John W. Francis (1789-1861) taught obstetrics in the College of
      Physicians and Surgeons from 1826-1830. Franklin Bache (1792-1864) was one
      of the authors of the <i>Dispensatory of the United States of America</i>,
      published in conjunction with George B. Wood, who was Professor of Materia
      Medica in the University of Pennsylvania, and who wrote also extensively

      venereal diseases was Freeman J. Bumstead (1826-1879), author of the most
      popular work upon the latter subject that has been issued from the medical
      press. He wras professor of these diseases at the College of Physicians in
      New York. His text-book vied with that produced by William H. Van Buren

      The first independent writer upon diseases of the eye was Dr. Frick
      (1793-1870), of Maryland. As illustrating how little our present
      specialties were then separated, it is worth while to remark that Dr.
      Edward Delafield (1794-1875), who, in 1826. was Professor of Obstetrics
      and Diseases of Women and Children in the College of Physicians and
      Surgeons, New York, delivered at the same time a special course of
      lectures upon diseases of the eye. The first man in the United States to

      "seventy years young." who was for a long time Professor of Anatomy at
      Harvard Medical College, but who was much more widely known and endeared

      eminence during the past hundred years. Without being invidious, there
      must, nevertheless, be mentioned John Collins Warren (1778-1856), first
      Professor of Anatomy and Surgery in the Harvard School, under whose
      auspices ether was first administered for the purpose of surgical
      anæsthesia, and who was the founder, in 1828, of the <i>Boston Medical and

      Pennsylvania. He was a tremendous worker, but wrote very little. He
      employed animal ligatures made of buckskin. John Syng Dorsey (1783-1818)

      To him is justly due the great honor of having performed the first
      rational and deliberate ovariotomy, which he did in 1809, his patient
      living for thirty-two years. The operation was performed without an
      anæsthetic, and considering the circumstances under which it was carried
      out has shed a lustre upon his name and brain which nothing can ever dim.
      By this performance he became practically the father of modern abdominal

      Perhaps the most eminent surgeon of the country was Valentine Mott
      (1785-1865), a pupil of Cooper and Bell, who taught in the College of
      Physicians and Surgeons, New York, until 1840, and in the University
      Medical School until 1860. He was a man of exceeding boldness and
      brilliancy, whose operations were performed at a time when anaesthesia was
      unknown, or was in its infancy, and who probably did more work in the
      surgery of the vascular system than any other surgeon who has ever lived.
      He was the first to tie the arteria innominata,&mdash;in 1818. As Gross
      wrote of him, he had a record of one hundred and thirty-eight ligations of
      various large arteries,&mdash;a record probably never equaled. He was also
      the first to do a successful extirpation of the clavicle for tumor,&mdash;an
      operation which at that time was considered very formidable. Though not a
      great writer himself, he is best known among students as the translator
      and editor of Velpeau's large work upon operative surgery.

      Dr. George McClellan (1796-1847) was the founder of the Jefferson Medical

      Physicians of Philadelphia and endowed a lectureship there. J. K. Rodger,

      known for his elaborate <i>System of Surgery</i>, in two large volumes,
      which has survived several editions and is still most highly esteemed.

      Of obstetricians and gynaecologists America has had no lack, and, in fact,
      the United States may almost be said to be the first home of gynaecology.
      Dr. Bard was the first Professor of Midwifery in King's College, now
      Columbia, New York, and the author of the first work upon the subject
      published in this country. In Philadelphia, Dr. Thomas C. James
      (1756-1835) was the first distinct teacher of obstetrics, his chair
      falling later to Dewees, already mentioned, who wrote extensively on
      midwifery and the diseases of children and of women. The same chair in the
      University of Pennsylvania was filled later by Hugh L. Hodge (1796-1873),
      a man of great originality and independence, who published a most
      elaborate and beautiful work upon his branch, which will always remain a
      classic. Charles D. Meigs, professor in the Jefferson School,
      Philadelphia, was the first to direct attention to thrombosis as a cause
      of sudden death in childbirth. He wrote both on gynaecology and midwifery.
      Bedford, of Baltimore, was another popular teacher and writer, with whom
      deserves to be mentioned William H. By ford, of Chicago, who wrote on both
      obstetrics and gynaecology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gynaecology owes much to the efforts of American schools and
      practitioners. The first successful attempt of McDowell's, already alluded
      to, was imitated by Nathan Smith in 1821; and during the next forty years
      thirty-six ovariotomies had been performed by eighteen different surgeons,<span

      Probably the most prominent passed figure in American gynaecology is J.
      Marion Sims (1813-1883), born in the South, where he invented his
      well-known speculum in 1852, whose introduction marked an epoch in the
      treatment of the pelvic diseases of women. It was also in South Carolina,
      among poor negro patients, that he perfected his method of plastic
      operations in the vagina for the relief of vesical fistulæ, which he later
      demonstrated in Paris to the astonishment of incredulous Parisian
      surgeons, who had almost uniformly failed in their attempts, and which he
      later successfully and brilliantly performed in all the capitals of
      Europe, where, as in this country, he enjoyed the greatest reputation. He
      was the founder of the great Woman's Hospital in New York, in 1855, an
      institution from which has proceeded more good gynæcological teaching than
      from any similar institution in the world Other ovariotomists<span

      gynaecologists of great merit were John L. Atlee, and his brother

      of New York, who wrote the first American treatise on ovarian tumors;
      Kimball, of Lowell, Massachusetts; and D. H. Agnew, of Philadelphia, who
      is, perhaps, yet better known as a general surgeon because of his <i>magnum

      this brief <i>résumé</i> of the names and achievements of the best-known
      American physicians and surgeons no longer living, it remains only to say
      a few words with regard to the general character of their work and
      attainments. It certainly was the case, during the earlier and middle
      portions of this century, that men had much to gain, beside addition to
      their vernacular, by study in foreign countries. Edinburgh and London
      were, at first, the centres to which men flocked; during the middle of the
      century they gathered in Paris, attracted by such men as Broussais,
      Velpeau, and others; after which the tide of travel turned toward Germany,
      where the government does more for the education of medical men and the
      furnishing of distinct opportunities than is done in any other part of the
      world. But, thanks to the influence of the foreign schools and the
      receptivity and natural quickness of the American mind, we have reached a
      point in this country when it is no longer necessary for American students
      to visit the foreign centres for this purpose, advantageous as these may
      be in many respects. The only feature in which we are yet lacking is the
      matter of government aid and the government control of medical
      institutions, by which better opportunities may be afforded for
      pathological study. Aside from this, and the centralization of cases which
      government control permits, it may be said that the Americans are in all
      respects as good practitioners as&mdash;and in most respects better than&mdash;their
      foreign colleagues. They evince more of humanity, more of real interest
      and care in their patients, and more consideration for their comfort and
      welfare; while, in all that pertains to fertility of invention, to
      originality of performance, and accuracy of work, they, as a rule, excel.
      Divested of glamour, American surgery, both general and special, is ahead
      of most of that which one can see abroad, and the therapeutics of the
      American profession certainly surpass those of any other nationality. No
      one need feel, then, that it is necessary to go abroad for any<span
      class="pagenum">299</span><a name="link299" id="link299"></a> purpose,
      unless it may be that polish and wide range of general information that
      necessarily come from travel and observation among other nations and
      peoples. In practical medicine, then, as in practical living, America
      leads the world.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is<span
      class="pagenum">300</span><a name="link300" id="link300"></a> not,
      perhaps, generally understood that we owe the term <i>anaesthesia</i> and
      the adjective <i>anaesthetic</i> to the genius of Dr. Oliver Wendell
      Holmes, who suggested their use to Dr. Morton. The term <i>anaesthesia</i>
      is applied to the artificial loss or deprivation of all sensation, which
      may be either local or general. It should be distinguished from <i>analgesia</i>,
      which means simply freedom from pain, consciousness being retained. In
      this respect local anaesthesia is really local analgesia, although the
      terms are confused in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anaesthesia, in its present sense, is truly a modern discovery, which is
      to be credited to the United States. In its less restricted sense,
      however, it is a condition brought about by numerous drugs,&mdash;intoxicants,
      narcotics, etc.,&mdash;some of which have been more or less in use for
      centuries. Anaesthesia is also a condition which may be produced in the
      hypnotic sleep,&mdash;a fact well recognized by the ancients, although the
      attention of scientific men was scarcely drawn to the fact until the days
      of the notorious Mesmer. The substances which may produce loss of
      consciousness may be taken intentionally or unintentionally, and maybe
      taken into the stomach, beneath the skin, or, when gaseous, through the
      lungs, in which absorption of the same into the blood is very speedy. It
      is not at all unlikely that the curious effects ascribed to some of the
      ancient oracles were due<span class="pagenum">301</span><a name="link301"
      id="link301"></a> to the inhalation of gases arising from natural springs
      or produced from other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common source of narcotic drugs has always been the vegetable
      kingdom; and the peculiar effects of the juices or other ingredients of
      the poppy, henbane, deadly-nightshade, Indian hemp, mandragora, etc., have
      been sung in poetry, rehearsed in prose, and known from almost prehistoric
      time. Ulysses and his companions were stupefied by <i>nepenthe</i>; a
      draught of vinegar and myrrh, or gall, was offered to Christ upon the
      cross, as it often was to malefactors; and Herodotus speaks of a peculiar
      habit of the Scythians, who produced some stupefying vapor,&mdash;probably
      from the seed of the hemp. From Biblical times, at least, the most common
      narcotic seems to have been alcohol in some of its numerous combinations.
      Furthermore, the effect of hemlock has been celebrated since the days of
      Socrates, who was permitted to drink it in order to soothe himself during
      his last hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mandragora seems to have had a great reputation in times past,&mdash;so
      much so that it is probable that more than one substance was included
      under this term. Apuleius, who lived about a century later than Pliny,
      wrote: "If any one is to have a member mutilated, burned, or sawed, let
      him drink half an ounce of mandragora with wine, and let him sleep till
      the member is cut away, without any pain or sensation." Among the Chinese
      and the Indians similar drugs seem to have been in frequent use,
      especially the <i>bhang</i>, ordinarily known as <i>hasheesh</i>. In many
      parts of the East something of this kind was administered to condemned
      criminals, as well as those compelled to undergo rude operations. It is
      said, also, that mild intoxication was produced among the fanatics of the
      East for the purpose of firing them to the point of heroic deeds, as it is
      also said that among the Druids the practice prevailed of partially
      stupefying the novitiates before initiating them into the most sacred and
      secret rites of their cult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy<span class="pagenum">302</span><a name="link302" id="link302"></a> de
      Chauliac was almost the only surgical writer of previous centuries who has
      referred to agents for the relief of pain, although during and before his
      time it was customary to give something to those about to undergo torture,
      by which to deaden their sensibility; and, though in the fables of all
      lands and all times something has always figured to which was ascribed the
      power of making people oblivious to pain or to the peculiarities of their
      situation, it is very difficult to learn just what, if any, particular
      composition was referred to or deserved such mention. There is allusion to
      something of the kind in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; again, in <i>Cymbeline</i>;
      and in one of Middleton's tragedies, published in 1567, entitled <i>Women
      Beware Women</i>, occurs this passage:&mdash;
    </p>
<p><br /></p>
    <p class="indent20">"I'll imitate the pities of old surgeons
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">To this lost limb, who, ere they show their art,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">Cast one asleep, then cut the diseased part."
    </p>
<p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Larrey, in his military campaigns, noticed the effect of cold in
      diminishing sensitiveness, and suggested that cold might be made a useful
      local anæsthetic. Many surgeons used to operate upon patients under the
      influence of alcoholic narcotization. It was in 1776 that Mesmer arrived
      in Paris and became the exponent of so-called "animal magnetism,"&mdash;later
      termed "mesmerism," now known as hypnotism,&mdash;under the influence of
      which he reduced to the state of unconsciousness of pain (i.e., analgesia,
      as well as the more complete condition, anæsthesia) a number of patients,
      who were operated upon without feeling the slightest suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in spite of the earnest attempts of humane surgeons in various parts
      of the world, no agent had been discovered which was proven safe and
      generally effectual, up to the time, for instance, of Velpeau, who in 1839
      wrote: "To escape pain in surgical operations is a chimera which we are
      not permitted to look for in our time."
    </p>
    <p>
      The substance known as sulphuric ether has been known<span class="pagenum">303</span><a
      name="link303" id="link303"></a> since the thirteenth century, when, as it
      appears, Raymond Lulli made certain&mdash;perhaps ambiguous&mdash;references
      to it. In 1540 it was known as the sweet oil of vitriol. It was not called
      an ether until 1730, when Godfrey spoke of it as such. It was frequently
      referred to during the last century by various writers, and the first
      reference to its inhalation seems to have been published in 1795 by
      Pearson. In a work by Beddoes, on Factitious Airs, published at Bristol,
      in 1796, is a statement that "Ether in pectoral catarrh gives almost
      immediate relief, both to the oppression and pain in the chest." Beddoes
      also states that after inhaling two spoonfuls he soon fell asleep. Later
      it was in somewhat general use internally for mitigating the pains of
      colic. By 1812 it was often inhaled for experiment or diversion, its
      peculiar exhilarating effects being generally known. So it is, perhaps,
      not strange that so soon as it was definitely recommended for purposes of
      surgical anæsthesia, a number of claimants for the honor of its discovery
      should quickly arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same with nitrous-oxide gas, which had been knowrn for a number
      of years, and which was repeatedly used for the purpose of anæsthesia
      before the introduction of ether for the same purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chloroform was discovered in the year 1831 by Guthrie, of Sackett's
      Harbor, New York, and about the same time by Soubeiran, in France, and
      Liebig, in Germany. But, although before the profession for sixteen years,
      it was not recommended for the same purpose as sulphuric ether until 1847,
      and then by Doctor&mdash;later, Sir&mdash;James Simpson.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all practical purposes we may limit further consideration of the
      history of anæsthesia to these three substances, and mainly to the
      consideration of the introduction and adoption of ether, which displaced
      nitrous oxide, preceded chloroform, and has held its own to the present
      day as the anaesthetic in most general use, although in<span
      class="pagenum">304</span><a name="link304" id="link304"></a> many
      respects inferior to chloroform. But the glamour of history pertains
      mostly to ether, because of the peculiar difficulties and incidents
      attending its production.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the honor of its discovery there are four claimants:&mdash;Crawford W.
      Long, of Danielsville, Ga.; Charles T. Jackson, of Plymouth, Mass.,&mdash;both
      physicians; Horace Wells, of Hartford, Vt., and William T. G. Morton, of
      Charleston, Mass.,&mdash;both dentists. It is only fair to each of these
      four men to consider briefly the merits of the claims made for each, while
      at the same time attributing the final success of the new agent to the
      happy accidents which permitted Morton to make a public demonstration of
      its power in the Massachusetts General Hospital, before such eminent men
      as Warren, Bigelow, and others, by whose influence and reputation the
      agent was at once received upon its merits. This was on the sixteenth of
      October, 1846,&mdash;a year which deserves to be memorable in the history
      of medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawford Long graduated, in 1839, from the medical department of the
      University of Pennsylvania, and settled in Jefferson, Georgia, where it
      seems to have been a common thing to have what was known as "ether
      frolics," during which the exhilarating effects of the inhalation of the
      drug were matters of common sport and amusement at various small
      gatherings. Long himself frequently inhaled the drug and often felt its
      benumbing effects. It is stated that it finally occurred to him to give it
      a trial in a surgical operation, and that, in May of 1842, he removed a
      small tumor from the neck of a patient thus anaesthetized and without any
      pain. Owing to the sparseness of the population and the lack of
      dissemination of medical knowledge in those days, no public report was
      made of these operations, which produced nothing more than local
      town-talk. A young student of Long's, named Wilhite, kept a negro boy
      under the influence of ether for some time, to Long's surprise. Long lived
      one hundred and thirty<span class="pagenum">305</span><a name="link305"
      id="link305"></a> miles from any railroad, and the first published account
      of his operations appeared in 1849, which was suggested by an account of
      Morton's work, which he had read in the editorials of the <i>Medical
      Examiner</i> for December, 1846. Long died in 1878, the unfortunate
      controversy in which the four claimants already mentioned participated
      being not yet concluded. Nevertheless, there is every reason to think that
      he is entitled to the credit of having first anaesthetized a patient with
      sulphuric ether for the purpose of producing insensibility to pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace Wells began the study of dentistry in 1834, in Boston, and later
      opened an office in Hartford, Connecticut. He seems to have been a young
      man of great ingenuity, continually making new instruments and devising
      new experiments. To him is to be credited the first operation ever
      performed without pain by the use of nitrous-oxide gas. In 1844 a Dr.
      Colton delivered a lecture in Hartford upon the subject of this gas. A
      young man who inhaled it, and became excited, ran against some furniture,
      badly bruising himself, but made no complaint of pain. Wells, noticing
      this, said to a by-stander that he believed that one, by inhaling a
      sufficient quantity, could have a tooth extracted or a leg amputated
      without pain. The following day he inhaled the gas himself and had a tooth
      extracted by a Dr. Higgs. Wells remained unconscious for a little while,
      and, on recovering consciousness, cried out: "A new era in tooth-pulling!
      It did not hurt me as much as the prick of a pin! It is the greatest
      discovery ever made!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once began the manufacture and use of the gas, which became quite
      general in that locality. His attention was also called to the action of
      the vapor of ether, which Dr. Marcy, a physician of Hartford, suggested to
      him to try as a substitute for gas; but Wells, finding it more difficult
      to administer, discontinued it and confined himself to the use of nitrous
      oxide. A month later Dr. Marcy gave<span class="pagenum">306</span><a
      name="link306" id="link306"></a> ether to a sailor for a small operation,
      the man feeling no pain. These experiences of Wells and Marcy occurred two
      years after Long's work with ether, each being in total ignorance of the
      experiments of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1845 Wells visited Boston for the purpose of introducing nitrous oxide
      as an anaesthetic, and called upon his fellow-dentist and old partner,
      Morton, among others. He was discouraged, with his lack of success,
      returned to Hartford, and continued the frequent use of gas for a couple
      of years longer, but met with no encouragement in introducing it for
      general surgical purposes, on account of prejudice and fear upon the part
      of physicians and surgeons. Wells died in January, 1848, a few days before
      the Medical Society of Paris passed a resolution that to him is due all
      the honor of having first discovered and successfully applied the use of
      vapors or gases whereby surgical operations could be performed without
      pain. There stands to-day in Hartford the monument erected by the city and
      the State, with the following inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
<p><br /></p>
    <p class="indent25">"Horace Wells, who discovered anæsthesia, November, 1844."
    </p>
<p><br /></p>
    <p>
      William T. G. Morton was born in 1819, and, after failing in business in
      Boston, in 1840 went to Baltimore and studied dentistry. In 1841 he
      entered the office of Horace Wells, above alluded to, as assistant, and in
      1842 became his partner, after having introduced a new kind of solder for
      fixation of artificial teeth to gold plates. In 1843 this partnership was
      dissolved, Wells moving to Hartford, while Morton, in 1844, entered the
      office of Dr. C. P. Jackson as a medical student, matriculating in the
      Harvard School, but never graduating. After Wells's visit to Boston,
      during which he tried to introduce "laughing gas," Morton and he had
      numerous interviews, especially with regard to this gas. Morton was not
      well versed in chemistry, and sought the advice of his medical preceptor,
      Jackson, with regard to its manufacture. Asking why<span class="pagenum">307</span><a
      name="link307" id="link307"></a> Morton wished to make it and being told
      the reason, Jackson suggested the use of' sulphuric ether, just as Marcy
      had suggested its use to Wells, saying that it was easy to procure, safe
      in employment, and equally productive of results. He also stated that the
      students at Cambridge College often inhaled ether for amusement.

    <p>
      On the evening of the same day, September 30, 1846, Morton administered
      ether for the extraction of a tooth, the patient stating that he had felt
      no pain. On the following day he visited the office of a well-known patent
      lawyer for the purpose of securing letters patent upon his supposed
      discovery. This lawyer, learning of Jackson's connection with the subject,
      took time to consider the matter, consulted with Jackson, and came to the
      conclusion that the patent must be a joint affair, neither one having
      exclusive right to claim it. But Jackson,<span class="pagenum">308</span><a
      name="link308" id="link308"></a> fearing the censure of the Massachusetts
      Medical Society should his name be connected with the patent, and Morton&mdash;as
      a dentist&mdash;having no such fine scruples, it was agreed that the
      patent should be made out in the names of both, but that Jackson was to at
      once assign his interest to Morton; in return for which he was to receive
      a ten per cent, commission. Meantime Morton called upon Warren, one of the
      surgeons in the Massachusetts General Hospital, who promised his
      co-operation and sent him an invitation to test his invention in the
      hospital on October 16. 1846. The clinic-room was filled when Morton
      placed the patient under the influence of his <i>letheon</i>, as he had
      named it; after which Warren removed a tumor from the neck of a young man,
      and as it appeared, without pain.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Upon the following day another operation was performed upon a young woman,
      with the same happy result, while on November 7th an amputation was made,
      entirely painlessly. At this time Morton endeavored to disguise the odor
      of the substance he was using by aromatic oils. It was not until the staff
      of the Massachusetts General Hospital declined to use an agent whose
      composition was kept secret that Morton revealed publicly the fact that
      this was nothing but sulphuric ether disguised by aromatics. From a report
      of the Commissioner of Patents, published a little later, the following
      paragraph is taken, the report being in the nature of a commentary upon
      the discovery:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been known for many years that the vapor of sulphuric ether, when
      freely inhaled, would intoxicate to the same extent as alcohol when taken
      into the stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact has stood, further, upon the pages of science for many years that
      the inhalation of sulphuric ether was productive of "temporary narcotic
      stimulant effects."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the issuance of letters patent Morton began selling office-rights,
      such being the custom then, as now, among the dental profession, who are
      much more commercial in<span class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310"
      id="link310"></a> their proclivities than their brethren of the medical
      profession. The result was an almost endless litigation, with the
      development of the greatest personal animosity and rivalry between Jackson
      and Morton, as well as the friends and descendants of the other claimants.
      Morton wrecked his fortune and ruined his health in his efforts to get
      substantial recognition and remuneration from the United States
      Government; and the history of his repeated attempts to interest Congress
      and the various officials of the government, from the president down, is
      instructive, but far from pleasing, reading. In these attempts he
      practically failed, and died from an illness contracted through exposure,
      after maddening disappointment, although he had been the recipient of
      numerous honors and some small pecuniary recognition from societies and
      individuals. Morton died in 1868. In reviewing the history of his life and
      labors there is much to justify the inscription upon the monument erected
      to his memory at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Boston:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Inventor and revealer of anæsthetic inhalation, before-whom in all
      time surgery was agony, and by whom pain in surgery was averted and
      annulled; since whom science has controlled pain</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles T. Jackson graduated at Harvard Medical College in 1829. after
      having led an already eventful career as geologist and mineralogist. He
      spent several years abroad, meeting many of the most distinguished men
      upon the Continent and displaying, in many ways, a great deal of
      scientific talent and mechanical ingenuity. In 1835 he opened, in Boston,
      the first laboratory for teaching analytical chemistry in the United
      States. A year later he was made State Geologist of Maine, and spent three
      years in this capacity. He also did a great deal of work upon the State
      geological surveys of Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and New York, while he
      was the first to call attention to the mineral resources of the southern
      shore of Lake Superior, where, in 1845. he opened up copper<span
      class="pagenum">311</span><a name="link311" id="link311"></a> and iron
      mines. In 1846 and 1847 he became deeply interested in the subject and
      discovery of anaesthesia, and after the successful introduction of ether
      by Morton, in the Massachusetts General Hospital, set up the claim that it
      was he who had suggested it to Morton. In a pamphlet, published a little
      later, he states: "In the year 1837 I discovered that ether-vapor was
      superior to alcohol as a remedy for the strangling and toxic effects of
      chlorine-gas after inhalations for that purpose in my laboratory." He then
      relates how he administered the vapor to himself for the relief of the
      irritation produced by inhaling chlorine, and describes his sensations
      upon going to sleep and awakening. This claim in its entirety was a great
      surprise to both Morton and Wells, and led to a most unseemly discussion,
      which degenerated into a downright professional fight. After the death of
      Wells, Jackson and Morton both claimed that nitrous-oxide gas was not an
      anaesthetic, and that insensibility to pain could not be produced by it,
      in consequence of which the use of the gas was quite discontinued. It
      became, then, simply a question of priority as to the administration of
      ether for relief of pain during surgical operations. Wells being dead,
      this brought Long into the conflict. Jackson visited Europe again, and
      presented his claim before numerous societies in such a way as to be
      recognized abroad as the discoverer of anaesthesia. The relative merits of
      the whole controversy appear to have been pretty well summed up in a
      memorial sent to the Senate and House of Representatives by several
      hundred members of the Massachusetts Medical Society, which contains the
      following paragraph:&mdash;"The undersigned hereby testify to your
      honorable bodies that, in their opinion, William T. G. Morton <i>first
      proved</i> to the world that ether would produce insensibility to the pain
      of surgical operations, and that it could be used with safety. In their
      opinion, his fellow-men owe a debt to him for this knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      In<span class="pagenum">312</span><a name="link312" id="link312"></a> the
      Public Garden in Boston there has been erected a monument to the memory of
      the discoverer of ether, the donor being, at the time, unable to mention
      the individual to whom it should be dedicated. Upon one face is this
      inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>To commemorate the discovery that the inhaling of ether causes
      insensibility to pain, first proven to the world at the Massachusetts
      General Hospital, in Boston, October, 1846</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon another face are these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>In gratitude for the relief of human suffering by the inhaling of
      ether a citizen of Boston has erected this monument, A.D. 1867</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The gift of Thomas Lee</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton's untimely death, largely due to disappointment and, as he thought,
      to persecution, has been already mentioned. In 1873 Jackson's mind became
      deranged, and he died in an asylum in 1880.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir James Paget has summed up the relative claims of our four contestants
      in an article entitled "Escape from Pain," published in the <i>Nineteenth
      Century</i> for December, 1879. He says: "While Long waited and Wells
      turned back and Jackson was thinking, and those to whom they had talked
      were neither acting nor thinking, Morton, the practical man, went to work
      and worked resolutely. He gave ether successfully in severe surgical
      operations, he loudly proclaimed his deeds, and he compelled mankind to
      hear him." As Dr. Morton's son, Dr. W. J. Morton, of New York, says, when
      writing of his father's claim: "Men used steam to propel boats before
      Fulton, electricity to convey messages before Morse, vaccine-virus to
      avert small-pox before Jenner, and ether to annul pain before Morton."
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for ether. I have already stated that chloroform was discovered by
      Guthrie in 1831. But, though discovered in this country, it was first
      introduced as an anæsthetic agent in Scotland, by Simpson, who, in 1847,
      at the age of thirty-six, began to direct his attention to the discovery<span
      class="pagenum">313</span><a name="link313" id="link313"></a> of some
      means of alleviating pain during childbirth, having a very large obstetric
      practice. Simpson was not satisfied with sulphuric ether, because of its
      strong and disagreeable odor, and inquired of his friend Waldie, Master of
      Apothecaries' Hall, of Liverpool, if he knew of nothing likely to be a
      satisfactory substitute. Waldie, acquainted with the chemical composition
      of chloric ether, suggested that chloroform be prepared from it and used.
      Simpson experimented with this in 1847, and established its anaesthetic
      properties, which he made known through a paper read on November 10th of
      the same year. It was arranged that upon the 13th of the month a public
      test should be made at the Royal Infirmary; but Simpson, who was to
      administer the chloroform, was unavoidably detained. Accordingly the
      operation was performed as of yore, without an anaesthetic, and during its
      performance the patient died upon the table. Had this death taken place
      during the employment of chloroform, it would have been the death-blow of
      that substance as an anaesthetic. The first public trial took place two
      days later, the test proving a great success. Simpson goes down in
      history, then, not as the discoverer of anaesthesia, but as the one who
      introduced chloroform for anaesthetic purposes. He died in 1870, and upon
      his bust in Westminster Abbey is this inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
<p><br /></p>
    <p class="indent10">"To whose genius and benevolence the world owes the blessings
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">derived from the use of chloroform for the relief of suffering."
    </p>
<p><br /></p>
    <p>
      It is a bit of most interesting medical history that after Simpson's
      announcement of his discovery he was violently and vehemently opposed by
      the Scottish clergy, who reviled him for endeavoring to relieve the pains
      of childbirth, basing their opposition upon the primeval curse: "In sorrow
      shalt thou bring forth children." And the beautiful ease with which
      Simpson refuted this childish sophistry must ever be memorable; for with
      one short argument he silenced his opponents and turned upon them the<span
      class="pagenum">314</span><a name="link314" id="link314"></a> ridicule of
      the entire profession. For he reminded them that the first operation
      recorded in history was performed under anaesthesia, since, when God
      created Eve from one of Adam's ribs, he "caused a deep sleep to fall upon
      Adam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cocaine is now such a universally recognized local anaesthetic that there
      is the best of reason for referring to it here&mdash;the more so because
      it affords another opportunity to do honor to a discoverer who has
      rendered a most important service not only to our profession, but to the
      world in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal active constituent of coca-leaves was discovered about 1860
      by Niemann, and called by him cocaine. It is an alkaloid which combines
      with various acids in the formation of salts. It has the quality of
      benumbing raw and mucous surfaces, for which purpose it was applied first
      in 1862 by Schroff and in 1868 by Moreno. In 1880 Van Aurap hinted that
      this property might some day be utilized. Karl Koller logically concluded
      from what was known about it that this anaesthetic property could be taken
      advantage of for work about the eye, and made a series of experiments upon
      the lower animals, by which he established its efficiency and made a
      brilliant discovery. He reported his experiments to the Congress of German
      Oculists, at Heidelberg, in 1884. News of this was transmitted with great
      rapidity, and within a few weeks the substance was used all over the
      world. Its use spread rapidly to other branches of surgery, and cocaine
      local anaesthesia became quickly an accomplished fact. More time was
      required to point out its disagreeable possibilities, its toxic
      properties, and the like, but it now has an assured and most important
      place among anæsthetic agents, and has been of the greatest use to
      probably ten per cent, of the civilized world. To Koller is entirely due
      the credit of establishing its remarkable properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The<span class="pagenum">315</span><a name="link315" id="link315"></a>
      writer makes no apology here for having introduced two distinct chapters,&mdash;one
      upon the history of antiseptic surgery, the other upon the history of
      anæsthesia. First of all, they are the two grandest medical discoveries of
      all time; and, secondly, they are of Anglo-Saxon origin,&mdash;the one
      British, the other American. To the introduction of anaesthetics and
      antiseptics is due a complete revolution of earlier methods, complete
      reversal of mortuary statistics, and the complete relief of pain during
      surgical operations; in other words, to these two discoveries the human
      race owes more of the prolongation of life and relief of suffering than
      can ever be estimated or formulated in words. What an everlasting disgrace
      it is that, while to the great murderers of mankind, men like Napoleon in
      modern times and his counterparts in all times, the world ever does honor,
      erects imposing monuments and writes volumes of encomiums and flattering
      histories, the men to whom the world is so vastly more indebted for all
      that pertains to life and comfort are scarcely ever mentioned save in
      medical history, while the world at large is even ignorant of their names.
      For this reason, if for none other, these chapters find an appropriate
      place in a work of this character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those interested in a somewhat more elaborate presentation of this subject
      may find it in an anniversary address delivered by the writer on October
      16, 1896 (the semicentennial of Morton's public demonstration), in the
      Medical School of the University of Buffalo, and published in the <i>Buffalo
      Medical Journal</i> of November, 1896.

      class="pagenum">316</span><a name="link316" id="link316"></a> surgery,
      and, in no small degree, modern treatment of all disease, have been so
      completely modified from previous methods by the introduction of the
      so-called antiseptic system that it seems to be only right to devote some
      time in such a work as this to a <i>résumé</i> of the history of the
      doctrines and experiments which have led to the perfection, as it would
      seem, of modern methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adjective "septic" comes from the Greek word "sepsis," which is often
      transferred to the English, and which means "putrefaction," or that which
      is putrid, or undergoing decomposition. From this word are formed two
      others,&mdash;namely, "aseptic" and "antiseptic,"&mdash;the one implying
      the exclusion of all causes of putrefaction and complete freedom from it,
      the other referring to methods employed to antidote the effect or
      counteract the influence of the agencies which produce sepsis or destroy
      them while still within the living body. By general usage the term
      "antiseptic" has been construed as the more comprehensive; hence, the
      modern method is usually spoken of as "antiseptic surgery," and hence the
      title above: "The History of Antisepsis."
    </p>
    <p>
      The principle underlying the resort to antiseptic methods is summed up in
      the expression, now so generally received,&mdash;the "germ-theory" of
      disease. It refers, in general, to the so-called zymotic, or infectious,
      diseases, whose manifestations are protean, which are all communicable by
      one means<span class="pagenum">317</span><a name="link317" id="link317"></a>
      or another, but which are not all necessarily contagious; some of which,
      being not at all amenable to surgical treatment, are regarded as "medical"
      diseases, while others, which occur mostly in connection with surgical
      cases, or which lead to conditions requiring surgical relief, are usually
      spoken of as "surgical" diseases. As excellent and only too common
      examples of these zymotic diseases may be mentioned tetanus, erysipelas,
      puerperal fever, typhoid fever, and those varied conditions which are
      generally grouped under the term "blood poisoning." Those which most
      concern the surgeon, and those in which most remarkable relief has been
      obtained are erysipelas and the various forms of blood poisoning. These,
      in their varied manifestations, have, until recently, been literally the
      terror of surgeons, and in military hospitals, for instance, have been the
      cause of more deaths than have ever resulted from wounds directly upon the
      battle-field. In civil hospitals, as well as in general and private
      practice, the mortality from these diseases was, until twenty-five years
      ago, simply frightful; while frequently, and over wide areas of territory,
      endemics and epidemics of puerperal fever would result in the death of
      almost every lying-in woman. In consequence of this terrible death-rate
      surgeons were afraid to operate, and certain classes of operations,
      especially those on the abdomen and joints, were never performed, except
      under most exacting circumstances. But few of the present generation can
      actually realize the completeness of the changes brought about by the
      adoption of the germ-theory, and the practical effect of its use as a
      working basis for combating disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      While no intelligent student at present denies that the infectious
      diseases&mdash;of which the above named are but a very few&mdash;are the
      result of the introduction into the body, from without, of minute living
      organisms, for the most part vegetable,&mdash;thus constituting them in
      reality, as they are often called, <i>parasitic</i> diseases,&mdash;but
      few are so familiar with<span class="pagenum">318</span><a name="link318"
      id="link318"></a> the history of modern discovery as to appreciate the
      basis upon which it has been demonstrated. The proof of the germ origin of
      disease is the legitimate outcome of the discovery of the actual causes of
      fermentation and putrefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the crude and often wild notions which have appeared here and
      there in literature of previous centuries, about the first accurate
      investigations bearing upon this subject were with reference to the cause
      of alcoholic fermentation. About the beginning of this century Appert
      published a monograph upon the Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable
      Substances, which consisted in placing them in closely corked or stoppered
      bottles, and exposing these to the temperature of boiling water.
      Gay-Lussac, the celebrated chemist, noticed that so soon as these vessels
      were opened, particularly if much exposed to air, their contents began to
      at once ferment or putrefy. This led to investigations into the production
      of alcohol, and the antiseptic effect of pure oxygen-gas; from which he
      concluded that oxvgen is necessary at the commencement of the process, but
      not throughout its continuance. Some thirty years later, Schwann, by the
      use of the microscope, then reasonably developed, discovered in fermenting
      substances numerous very minute globular bodies, which had the power of
      reproduction, and which were present in juices or fluids undergoing
      alcoholic fermentation, but not in others, and which he concluded to be
      the exciting cause. Schwann also discovered that if, in vessels sealed by
      Appert's method, lie allowed air which had been previously heated to come
      in contact with the fluids, no change resulted; from which it was evident
      that it was something other than the gaseous elements of the air which
      provoked fermentation. Schwann's investigations were corroborated, in
      1843, by Helmholtz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schwann's results were contested by Liebig, one of the most eminent
      chemists of his time, who proposed a very different<span class="pagenum">319</span><a
      name="link319" id="link319"></a> theory, ascribing putrefaction to the
      absence of oxygen and to the upsetting of molecular arrangements. He
      believed that non-nitrogenous substances did not spontaneously undergo
      putrefaction when pure, but they must be brought into contact with some
      substance already undergoing change, which latter was called a <i>ferment</i>,
      and which converted the oxygen of the air into carbonic acid. According to
      him, the ferment was some material undergoing decomposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next researches on this subject were those of Schroeder and Dusch, in
      1854 who studied the question whether filtration of air would prevent the
      fermentation of boiled fluids to which such filtered air might have
      access. The material used for filtration was cotton-wool; and they showed
      that air filtered through it was deprived of the agencies which produce
      fermentation. Then came Pasteur, who repeated the experiments of his
      predecessors and elaborated and confirmed them. He also found that it was
      not necessary to filter the air of its contained particles, but that if it
      were simply left undisturbed until these had settled by gravity, it might
      then be brought in contact with putrescible substances without causing any
      putrefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1870, in a lecture upon haze and dust, Tyndall demonstrated beautifully
      and in public the presence of countless particles in the air, as well as
      that these were the agencies operating to produce undesirable changes in
      organic substances. Both Pasteur and Tyndall, as well as others, showed,
      as did also Lister, that heat as well as filtration was sufficient to
      render these particles innocuous. As the result of these and numerous
      other experiments, by various observers, which there is no time here to
      recount, it was gradually and irrefutably established that the gases of
      the air, <i>per se</i>, are powerless to cause fermentation or
      putrefaction in boiled fluids or tissues, or in material germ-free when
      exposed. It was sufficient, in order to so purify<span class="pagenum">320</span><a
      name="link320" id="link320"></a> the air, to either previously heat it or
      filter it through cotton-wool or through fluids inimical to germ-life,
      while the boiling of organic material or its subjection to the boiling
      heat of water was sufficient to destroy all germ-activity in it at the
      time, or, as we say now, to sterilize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, and even before any minute and systematic study of bacteria,&mdash;i.e.,
      before the inauguration of bacteriology as a separate department of
      scientific study,&mdash;it was practically established that the agencies
      which produce putrefactive changes or fermentation were minute particles
      which were ever present in almost every substance, and that by heat or
      something corresponding to filtration it was possible to remove them or
      destroy their activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much had been established without reference to the etiology of disease.
      In order now to study the germ-theory of disease as applied to man we must
      go back a little, neglecting the vagaries or the pure conjectures of the
      ancients, to the era of pure philosophic speculation,&mdash;perhaps to the
      days of Needham and Buffon.&mdash;to the middle of the previous century,
      when scientists and naturalists began to discuss the so-called spontaneous
      generation of life; for it is well known that fluids, like milk and
      others, abound with life after a few days of exposure; and it was supposed
      that the living organisms it contained had a spontaneous origin. This
      question of the spontaneous beginning of minute living forms was agitated
      for a century, or practically until Tyndall and Pasteur gave it its
      death-blow by their accurate and convincing demonstrations. There was no
      lark of experimentation, but there was lack of exact knowledge and of
      accurate deduction from facts observed. The bacteria&mdash;which at that
      time were usually spoken of as "monads" and "vibriones," because of their
      spontaneous motion&mdash;were found under varying circumstances, which,
      not being scientifically inquired into, led thinking men into a most
      perplexing condition<span class="pagenum">321</span><a name="link321"
      id="link321"></a> of mind. The two most ardent recent advocates of
      spontaneous generation were Bastian, of England, who wrote an elaborate
      treatise upon the subject, and Jeffries Wyman, of Cambridge, Mass., who
      gave it the benefit of all his influence. But, under the influence of
      blows dealt from the side of the physical laboratory by Tyndall, and from
      that of the biologists by Pasteur, the theory was weakened and effectually
      killed, so that to-day no one thinks of such a thing. On the contrary,
      life seems to be inevitably the gift of a preceding organism; and while
      the real origin of life is as unknown to-day as ever, there is not a
      single fact in the possession of scientists now justifying the view that
      life can have a spontaneous origin. Moreover the researches of Pasteur and
      others into alcoholic fermentation and the rôle played by the minute
      yeast-plant, and the early researches of Pasteur, Davaine, and Koch into
      the rôle of micro-organisms in producing disease in animals, and the
      scientific and elaborate study of bacteria and vegetable molds,
      inaugurated by Cohn and continued by many others, have as their legitimate
      outcome the creation of bacteriology as a science, and the establishment
      of the fact that the real condition in the so-called infectious diseases
      is one of fermentative or putrefactive alterations in the fluids and
      tissues of the living body, corresponding in minutiæ to the changes
      produced in saccharine fluids by the yeast-plant, or in decomposing animal
      or vegetable matter by the many known bacteria which are capable of
      producing such changes. To put it in another way, disease is simply an
      expression of the fact that these minute organisms, which are visible only
      under high powers of the microscope and which reproduce their kind with
      astonishing rapidity, gaining access to the surface or interior of the
      body, begin there to thrive and multiply, taking up from the living animal
      material for their own nourishment, thus robbing their host of that upon
      which his tissues must live, while at the same time, as the result of
      their activity, they produce<span class="pagenum">322</span><a
      name="link322" id="link322"></a> various substances which, so far as they
      are concerned, are excretory in nature, and many of which are extremely
      poisonous to the animal organism which harbors them. Such a disease as
      puerperal fever, for instance, is simply an expression of the fact that
      within the living human body there is going on active putrefactive action
      by which the internal cells are being destroyed. this destruction being
      progressive and often far-reaching; and that, as the result of their
      presence in the still living body, the noxious or toxic excretory
      materials of which they get rid are absorbed, in consequence of which such
      varying symptoms as nausea, fever, purging, vomiting, delirium, and many
      other symptoms are produced, the objective evidence of their local
      activity being the actual destruction of tissues, as is seen in cases of
      abscess, phlegmonous erysipelas, etc. The condition known everywhere as
      gangrene, when moist and offensive, is nothing but the putrefaction of
      tissues <i>en masse</i> which are not yet detached or separated from the
      living body of which they but recently formed a living part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiments with organic material outside the body have amply demonstrated
      that such putrefactive processes can be checked by certain precautions&mdash;such
      as filtration of air, heat, etc. It remained for the genius of Lister to
      show how similar processes of putrefaction and exclusion of germs could be
      made serviceable for the prevention of disease in the human race. To
      Lister, then, is due the credit of having originated the antiseptic system
      and brought about a condition long yearned for by surgeons throughout the
      world, but never previously attained. What a revolution he wrought by his
      masterly researches can be appreciated only when one compares the impunity
      with which surgeons now perform operations which, in the previous era were
      regarded as absolutley unjustifiable&mdash;a conclusion amply warranted by
      the statistics of that era.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great as the credit due to Lister, it is equally desirable to state that
      his work was, for the most part, based upon Lister's, the<span
      class="pagenum">323</span><a name="link323" id="link323"></a> researches
      of Tyndall, Pasteur, and Koch, which had established the germ nature of
      the terrible infectious diseases and the germicidal effect of filtration,
      of heat, and of certain other substances and methods which permitted of
      the development of his own system.

      The antiseptic method, as it has since been known, was naturally at first
      crude, although its scientific basis has never been shaken; and that it
      has been since, in large measure, modified, and that surgeons now resort
      to little, if any, of the paraphernalia which first made it such a formal
      proceeding, in no regard shake the scientific nature of its foundation,
      but rather have tended ever to corroborate it and establish it more and
      more firmly. Lister began with the supposition that the air contains the
      germs which are most active and pernicious in producing disease. It has
      been since learned that air-contact is, perhaps, least of all to<span
      class="pagenum">324</span><a name="link324" id="link324"></a> be dreaded.
      We, however, recognize the germs as always the efficient agents, though we
      have since learned that other sources of contamination are much more to be
      dreaded than air. It had been the custom, up to Lister's time, to observe
      usually the ordinary forms of cleanliness, but, not appreciating the
      multitude of germs which lurk in and about the skin, it had not been
      customary to scour and prepare it as we have learned to do since Lister's
      day. The ligatures and instruments which were used and the dressings which
      were applied, as well as the sponges used during the operation, usually
      went through the ordinary forms of cleansing; and yet Lister's
      investigations showed the utter inadequacy of such preparation. His most
      important object-lesson, however, was that everything that came in contact
      with fresh or bleeding tissues might carry infectious material (i.e.,
      germs), unless it had itself been thoroughly freed from their presence.
      Accordingly, the system taught the accurate preparation of everything.&mdash;from
      the skin of the patient, which was to be carefully cleansed and shaven, to
      the hands of the operator, which were to be scrupulously scrubbed, as well
      as those of every assistant who might handle or touch any of the
      instruments or dressing materials. It included, also, the careful
      preparation of sponges, sutures, and ligature materials, all of which were
      kept protected from air-contact and in antiseptic solutions until the
      moment of their use. The dressing materials were impregnated with
      substances like carbolic acid, which had been proven to be germicidal; and
      impermeable material, like oiled silk, was used to cover the surgical
      dressing, in order that fluids which might leak through should not come in
      contact with the air, which might permit of their putrefaction, while, at
      the same time, air from without could have no access to the deeper parts
      thus protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original method of Lister was very elaborate, and included also the
      dissemination throughout the air of the operating-room<span class="pagenum">325</span><a
      name="link325" id="link325"></a> of a vapor of carbolic acid, which was
      disagreeable, sometimes almost fatal, to operators and bystanders alike,&mdash;its
      use being based upon the notion that the air was the substance most to be
      dreaded. The instruments were placed in strong antiseptic solutions,
      usually carbolic, which were pungent and irritating to the hands of all
      that came in contact with them. So thoroughly and ubiquitously were
      antiseptic materials employed that it was soon learned that they were of
      themselves rather injurious to the best interests of the patients upon
      whom they were employed. Their use, of course, was contingent upon the
      notion, then everywhere prevalent, that powerful substances must be used
      in order to counteract the activity of the much-dreaded germs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of time, however, it was learned that the air was not so
      much to be dreaded as had been supposed, and that even if it came in
      contact with raw tissues infection did not certainly follow. It was found
      also that the antiseptic solutions which had been so freely used for
      irrigating or drenching the parts during an operation were by no means
      essential, and that tissues often healed better which had not been
      subjected to so much irritation. It was learned further that it was not
      necessary to impregnate dressings with these same solutions, providing, in
      the first place, they were carefully sterilized by the application of
      heat, which in time came to be used for the purpose of sterilizing
      everything not injuriously affected by it. In consequence, then, all
      dressing material, silk ligatures, instruments, nail-brushes, etc., were
      subjected to live steam or to boiling water for twenty minutes or more,
      which was demonstrated to be completely effective in the destruction of
      all organic or bacterial life. This, of itself, was a very great
      simplification of the antiseptic method. It was also demonstrated that the
      vital fluids of the animal body had of themselves great germicidal power,
      and that the strong antiseptic fluids previously used tended rather to
      impair<span class="pagenum">326</span><a name="link326" id="link326"></a>
      this power than to enhance it. Accordingly, fluids for irrigation came to
      be used only when there was some noxious material to be washed away. It
      was found that fresh wounds healed most kindly when least irritated by
      applications of any kind, providing only that nothing came in contact with
      them which could infect them. And, in this way, as well as by resort to
      simpler rather than complicated procedures, there was gradually
      substituted for the so-called <i>anti</i>septic method that which is now
      everywhere recognized, and always practiced, when possible,&mdash;i.e.,
      the aseptic method. This simply means that it is very much better to
      exclude germs than to permit of their access and then try to kill them
      after they have lodged. The aseptic method is, therefore, now in vogue,
      and among the best operators always the so-called <i>dry</i> method of
      operating, which means that, so far as possible, nothing not absolutely
      needed at the moment should come in contact with the field of operation.
      This has been, in many respects, a great advance over the older antiseptic
      method, though based upon absolutely the same recognition of causes, being
      only an improvement in technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefits of Lister's studies, and of that which has grown out of them,
      are simply incalculable. The surgical infections which, thirty years ago,
      were the dread of all operating surgeons, have practically disappeared
      from civil and military hospitals. I esteem myself fortunate in this,&mdash;that
      I have been a living witness of the benefit of change from the old to the
      new, since when I began my work, in 1876 (over twenty years ago), as a
      hospital <i>interne</i>, in one of the largest hospitals in this country,
      it happened that during my first winter's experience,&mdash;with but one
      or two exceptions,&mdash;every patient operated upon in that hospital, and
      that by men who were esteemed the peers of any one in their day, died of
      blood poisoning, while I myself nearly perished from the same disease.
      This was in an absolutely new building, where expenditure had been lavish;
      one whose<span class="pagenum">327</span><a name="link327" id="link327"></a>
      walls were not reeking with germs, as is the case yet in many of the old
      and well-established institutions. With the introduction of the antiseptic
      method, during the two years following, this frightful mortality was
      reduced to the average of the day, and in the same institution to-day is
      done as good work as that seen anywhere. The same was true without
      exception in the great hospitals of the Old World; and in Paris, where,
      thirty years ago, famous surgeons would go from one end of the building to
      the other, handling one patient after another without ever washing their
      hands, and where erysipelas and contagion of various kinds were thoroughly
      distributed, as it were, impartially, now the successors of these very
      same men, employing modern methods, get results which challenge
      comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world has seen few extensive wars since the introduction of the
      antiseptic system; but, in such as have occurred, its incalculable value
      in military hospitals has been amply demonstrated. The modern soldier is
      now taught how to make a prompt occlusive and antiseptic dressing of the
      wound which he may receive upon the battle-field, which, from the moment
      of its attention, continues to be treated according to the same
      enlightened method after he reaches the field-hospital, or when sent to
      the rear; so that men now receive extensive injuries to joints and to
      viscera, which previously were either promptly fatal, or fatal within a
      few days from erysipelas and hospital gangrene, from which they recover
      with useful&mdash;often with nearly perfect&mdash;limb or function of part
      restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military hospital of to-day is, therefore, robbed of the terrors which
      used to make it almost a charnel-house; hospital gangrene, the special
      dread of active army-surgeons in time past, has almost disappeared from
      the category of known diseases, and one of the greatest dangers menacing
      the modern soldier has been removed from modern civilized life. The method
      has met with universal adoption among all<span class="pagenum">328</span><a
      name="link328" id="link328"></a> civilized races and peoples, and all this
      through the energy and talent of the originator, now Sir Joseph Lister.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the recognition of the germ nature of so many acute diseases has come
      also systematic study of the use of antiseptics internally; and, while no
      such exceeding satisfaction has resulted from labors in this direction, we
      have, nevertheless, learned that most of the infectious diseases of the
      alimentary canal&mdash;for example, cholera, typhoid, etc.&mdash;are well
      attacked by means of antiseptics administered internally; that many of the
      conditions that depress and annoy are due to the presence of germs in the
      alimentary canal and the urinary system, and are best combated by means
      which shall remove these agencies, if not destroy them. It has been
      learned, also, that many forms of skin disease are parasitic, and that
      these are only successfully treated by the employment of antiseptics
      externally.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the recognition of the germ nature of infectious diseases and the
      germicidal properties of certain substances, now spoken of as antiseptics,
      have kept pace, the one with the other; and in consequence the world has
      reached a period in its medical history never even dreamed of by our
      forefathers, when the infectious diseases have been shown to be
      practically preventable and, to a large extent, curable by the employment
      of drugs directed especially against their exciting cause. What the years
      to come may have in the way of further discovery in this direction, we may
      not foresee. So far as one can at present see ahead, the next advances
      must be in the direction either of means which shall fortify the human
      organism against the inroads of bacteria, or disease-germs, or else in the
      discovery of substances, such as we do not yet know, which shall be at the
      same time poisonous to the germs and innocuous to the patient, to whom
      they may be administered in doses sufficient for their purpose. Any
      material possessing these properties would be an ideal antiseptic for
      internal purposes. At present we only approach our ideal, but are very<span
      class="pagenum">329</span><a name="link329" id="link329"></a> far from its
      active realization. In no way would mankind be more greatly benefited than
      by the prosecution of studies which may lead to satisfactory results in
      either of these directions.

      AN EPITOME OF THE HISTORY OF DENTISTRY.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he<span
      class="pagenum">330</span><a name="link330" id="link330"></a> following is
      a <i>synopsis of an address</i> delivered at the opening of the session of
      the Dental Department of the University of Buffalo, in October, 1895. It
      is appended here because it is certainly apropos of the topics herein
      considered, the colloquial form being retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Called upon at short notice to welcome you here, and to offer remarks of
      general professional interest, it occurs to me to be retrospective for
      awhile and to consider the steps by which that which was once an
      exceedingly crude art has been developed until now it is an exact science.
      In other words, I would invite your attention, for a time, to the history
      of dentistry. At a time even before our combined art and science had a
      definite history we find that gold was used among the Egyptians for the
      purpose both of filling teeth and of supporting and directing them. In the
      bodies of many Egyptian mummies, especially of the higher class, there
      have been found teeth filled with gold or with wood which was covered with
      gold. It is known, also, that the Hindoos and Egyptians inserted
      artificial teeth and that some of these were made of wood, often covered
      with gold, and held in place by gold or silver bands and wires. Herodotus,
      who traveled so extensively in Egypt and wrote most entertainingly of his
      travels, has noted the division of medicine among the Egyptians into
      special branches and the existence of physicians, each of whom<span
      class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331" id="link331"></a> applied
      himself to one disease and not to more. "Some," said he, "are for the
      eyes, others for the head, <i>others for the teeth</i>, and others for
      internal disorders."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is known, also, that about 300 B.C. Erasistratus deposited in the
      temple of the Delphian Apollo an <i>odontogogue</i>, or tooth-forceps,
      made of <i>lead</i>, intimating thereby that only those teeth should be
      drawn which were loose enough to be extracted with such an instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celsus, who was a contemporary of Christ and of Cæsar, was the first to
      recommend the use of a file within the mouth for the purpose of removing
      irritating edges and points of teeth. He also recommended bursting hollow
      teeth by putting into them pepper-corns, which should absorb moisture,
      swell, and thus break the teeth in pieces. He also recommended to take
      particular pains to try to shake or manipulate teeth loose before
      extracting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galen, about 150 A.D., taught that teeth were true bones and that the
      canine teeth should be called "eye" teeth, because they were supplied by a
      branch of the optic nerve. Aëtius, 300 A.D., apparently discovered the
      foramina at the roots of the teeth through which the nerves enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rome false teeth and sets of teeth constructed of ivory and fastened
      with gold wire existed as early as the Laws of the XII Tables, and before
      the days of Roman civilization it is known that the Etruscans were skilled
      in manipulation of gold within the mouth, while your dean has described
      and has, I believe, in his possession beautiful examples of Etruscan work
      of this kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Arabs, after the Arabian domination of the then civilized world,
      attention was paid to the teeth, although this was considered a very
      inferior part of the physician's work. Among these Arabians much later,
      and in spite of their study of Greek writers and their translations from
      the Greek, there may still be met such passages as<span class="pagenum">332</span><a
      name="link332" id="link332"></a> this from Garriopontus, 1045 A.D.: "On
      the island of Delphi a painful molar tooth, which was extracted by an
      inexperienced physician, occasioned the death of a philosopher, for the
      marrow of the tooth, which originates from the brain, ran down into the
      lungs and killed that philosopher." For all that I know, this is the first
      record of a death after extraction of a tooth. Albucassis, 1100 A.D., gave
      directions for replacing lost teeth by natural or ivory substitutes. For
      centuries extraction of teeth had been and was considered a critical and
      dangerous operation, although itinerant quacks drew them without
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman poets and satirists made many allusions, in their day, to the
      teeth and to operations performed upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Middle Ages the most celebrated medical school that the world
      ever saw was founded at Saleraum, and was for several centuries the
      headquarters to which resorted men who desired to study medicine and
      patients from all parts of the world who desired to be cured of various
      diseases. It was a favorite stopping-place for crusaders on their way to
      and from the Orient, and history relates many interesting episodes
      pertaining to such visits. Under the influence of this school dentistry
      was more or less cultivated by those who practiced surgery. Bruno, of
      Langoburo (about 1250), mentions various operations upon the teeth and the
      antrum, although that was nearly four hundred years before Highmore
      carefully described this cavity. Johannes Arculanus (Giovanni d'Arcoli),
      in the fifteenth century, filled teeth with gold. I must digress for a
      moment to speak of another suggestion of Arculanus's. You know that quite
      recently the use of the magnet has once more come into vogue among
      oculists for the removal of foreign particles of iron or steel from the
      anterior chamber or the globe of the eye. It was Arculanus who, some five
      hundred years ago, suggested extraction of iron splinters from the eye by
      means of the <i>attraction of amber electrified by friction</i>. (For
      School of Salernum<span class="pagenum">333</span><a name="link333"
      id="link333"></a> see page 72.)
    </p>
    <p>
      During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the French surgeons,
      especially Dionis and Verduc, made many practical contributions to
      dentistry. In 1728 Fauchard wrote in Paris the first complete work on
      dentistry,&mdash;<i>Le Chirurgien Dentiste, ou Traité des Dents</i>.
      Auzebi, of Lyons, wrote another. Le Cluse first mentioned the English
      turnkey for extraction. Jourdain introduced a number of new and
      appropriate instruments and new forms of artificial teeth. Bourdet,
      dentist to the king, made artificial palates. Porcelain teeth were first
      introduced in France in 1774.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Germans cosmetic dentistry, though still the favorite field of
      charlatans, was greatly cultivated. Serré wrote a treatise on <i>Toothache
      in the Fair Sex During Pregnancy</i>, but the first public dental clinic
      in Germany was not established until 1855, by Professor Albrecht, and in
      Vienna. It has been in Vienna, among the Germans, that dentistry has been
      in time past most honored, and was taught when it was scarcely recognized
      in the other German universities. Private dental institutions were also
      first established in Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the tooth-extracting instruments, the dental forceps in crude form
      is the earliest, the first on record, perhaps, being that deposited by
      Erasistratus in the Delphian temple, as already mentioned. For hundreds of
      years these instruments scarcely changed in shape. It was Garengeot who
      invented the <i>key</i>, early during the last century. Before that, and
      for awhile, dentists who had abandoned the forceps used an instrument
      known as <i>the pelican</i>,&mdash;said to much resemble the skid used by
      lumbermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before artificial (porcelain) teeth came into use the following
      substitutes were employed, their estimated value being in accordance with
      the order in which I name them:
    </p>
    <p>
      Human<span class="pagenum">334</span><a name="link334" id="link334"></a>
      teeth, animal teeth, hippopotamus tusk and teeth, elephant-ivory, and
      bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Human Teeth</i>.&mdash;Transplantation of teeth was at one time very
      common. After being inserted, they were held in place by pivots and
      ligatures, springs, and upon bases. The pivot method also included the use
      of screws. Ligatures for fastening teeth were made of silk-worm gut,&mdash;which,
      now so common in surgery, was used for this purpose, perhaps, two hundred
      years ago,&mdash;of gold wire, etc. The method by ligatures is the
      earliest of all. Human teeth have always been more or less expensive if
      fresh, few people being willing to part with sound teeth except for a
      money consideration. In 1784 a Philadelphia dentist offered, in an
      advertisement, two guineas each for sound front teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Animal Teeth</i>.&mdash;These were largely used, being held in place
      the same way as above, the principal objection being that it was
      difficult, often impossible, to match human with animal teeth. It was
      found, also, that the latter decayed very much more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hippopotamus-ivory</i>.&mdash;This was at one time very extensively
      used. It was carved into the shape of the missing teeth, and was held upon
      a base; or it was carved into shape as a base upon which to rest human
      teeth. Most often it was used as a base for pivoting. Not infrequently a
      block was carved out which represented gum, teeth, and all, and partial
      dentures of this complex type were often so deftly fashioned as to be very
      realistic, the part representing the gum being colored. Unfortunately no
      dye nor color in the mouth could be made permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Elephant-ivory</i>.&mdash;This was used for the cheaper grades of work,
      being less durable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bone</i>.&mdash;Bone was still more objectionable, and was used for
      only the cheapest work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artificial porcelain teeth were first introduced in France in 1774 and in
      America in 1817. Those which were first made<span class="pagenum">335</span><a
      name="link335" id="link335"></a> were so large, awkward, rough, and
      ill-fashioned, without attempt to represent the gum, as to bear no
      comparison to the artistic products of to-day. They were intended for the
      most part for attachment to ivory bases. The artificial dentures made for
      George Washington were of this general character, and, although they
      called forth his encomiums in a letter to his dentist expressing his
      gratitude, they would pass for very shabby productions today. One of the
      greatest advances in dentistry was the introduction of gold bases as a
      substitute for the baseplates previously made of ivory or bone. This is
      distinctly an American invention, and is to be credited to Gardette, of
      Philadelphia, who produced the first bases of this kind in 1787. Since
      then other metals have been used only because cheaper, none having the
      valuable properties of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gutta-percha was introduced for this and various dental purposes in
      England, in 1851, by Trueman. In 1851, too, came Goodyear's process of
      vulcanizing, which the dental profession were at first slow to avail
      themselves of, but which led, as its value was recognized later, to
      expensive and almost endless litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another most valuable American invention was that of taking impressions by
      the use of plaster. This was introduced about 1844-'45. This method
      permitted the making of socket-plates, which, of itself, was a long step
      in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for a very brief epitome of some of the most interesting facts in
      the history of dentistry. Did time permit, the matter would warrant
      treatment at much greater length. But what now is to be said of the
      condition of dentistry to-day? First of all, that it is no longer
      relegated to charlatans and itinerants, but is studied, practiced, and
      honored by men of the ablest minds and of the highest type. There is
      to-day scarcely any branch of applied science which calls for greater
      qualifications or for greater combination<span class="pagenum">336</span><a
      name="link336" id="link336"></a> of mental endowment and manual dexterity
      than does dentistry. We, in New York, find ourselves now in position where
      the State has assumed not only to regulate the practice of dentistry, but
      even to pass upon the qualifications of those who propose to study it. In
      the assumption of this task by the State there is paid, perhaps, the
      greatest possible compliment to its dignity and to its importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great field of medicine is now altogether too vast, and the various
      branches which pertain to it are too complex, to permit a mastery of all
      its details by any one mind. The man does not live who to-day can be
      considered <i>facile princeps</i> in more than a few departments of
      medicine. Life is too short to permit of it, and the study is altogether
      too extensive. There is also a growing public demand for specialization of
      work, and there is probably more excuse for the perpetuation of dentistry
      as a specialty than for almost any other branch. Nevertheless, it is
      necessary constantly to repress a tendency toward a failure to comprehend
      the general principles underlying all medical specialties, and it has been
      hard, at least until recently, to impress upon the men of the dental
      profession that they were really only practicing a branch of medicine, and
      that, in disregarding a general and comprehensive knowledge of the
      fundamental branches, they were but poorly preparing themselves for the
      practice of a dignified specialty. Certainly dentistry makes as many
      demands for mechanical training, digital dexterity, familiarity with the
      properties of materials, etc., as does. surgery, and in some respects even
      more. Of course, to a certain extent in these respects it is like a
      mechanical trade. The great trouble with the dental profession, until very
      recent times, is that they have regarded their work too much as a trade
      and not enough as a profession. By taking the latter view of it the work
      is ennobled and their interest for it cultivated. By taking the trade view
      of it they have lost those finer features which<span class="pagenum">337</span><a
      name="link337" id="link337"></a> lift mechanical work out of the mere
      level of a trade. Moreover, men in time past have been guilty of
      altogether too much trades-union tactics, which are vehemently opposed to
      professional ethics, and this has been another feature to degrade rather
      than elevate dentistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has been indeed a great misfortune, for men have been misled by the
      need for cultivation of their hands, or their manual powers, and have been
      persuaded away from a finer study of fundamental principles upon which the
      whole practice of dentistry should be based. And so it has happened that
      men have been so ambitious to become perfect operators that they have
      neglected anatomy, physiology, chemistry, and pathology, have even
      neglected odontology, sacrificing everything else to their work as mere
      artificers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one scrutinizes the subject properly, there is no reason why there
      should not grow up a class of men fitted to attend to any lesion of the
      mouth or of the parts adjoining. In other words, there is no reason why
      there is not more excuse for true oral surgeons than there is for any
      other class of specialists, save possibly those who treat the eye. Aural
      surgery, nasal surgery, pelvic surgery, rectal surgery, etc., are simply
      voluntary limitations and applications of general surgery to special
      parts; but he who attends to the teeth has to do so much work of a
      character which the surgeon is not called upon to perform in any other
      area, that I have always claimed the oral surgeon deserved a place, as he
      had a field, by himself. Nevertheless, the knowledge which shall fit a man
      for such work is not to be obtained in the ordinary dental course, nor in
      three years of study, even under the best of auspices. The man who would
      be an ideal oral surgeon must be not only generally familiar with anatomy
      and physiology, but must thoroughly know the embryology of the face and
      teeth, the physiology not alone of the organs of the mouth, but of all the
      secreting glands and the chemistry of all their secretions;<span
      class="pagenum">338</span><a name="link338" id="link338"></a> not only the
      anatomy of the cranium, but general anatomy as well, and even comparative
      anatomy. He must be well informed in the explanations of all the
      congenital defects met about the face and mouth; he must be familiar not
      only with the ordinary principles of pathology and bacteriology, but he
      will find in the fluids about the mouth such a fertile opportunity for
      bacteriological study that, be he ever so expert or erudite, he has still
      much left to investigate in this direction. There is no disease-germ with
      which he can afford to be unfamiliar, and, as any form of tumor may be
      found in or about the mouth, he should be familiar with the entire subject
      of tumors and their surgical treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, he must be familiar not only with the physical properties of
      metals and the various materials used in plastic dentistry, nor expert
      alone in the operations about the teeth, but, inasmuch as he has to cope
      with various wounds, injuries, and operations about the soft parts, he
      must be thoroughly familiar with the principles of wound-healing; with the
      causes of sepsis and the agents which produce it, and the means of
      avoiding it; in other words, he must have a general training in operative
      surgery, and, according to my ideal, which may be high, he should be a man
      able to do almost any operation in surgery before he limits himself to
      surgery of the mouth. Unless he have this ability, he will not do such
      operation as well as a general surgeon can, because the underlying
      principles are the same, and the latter will have the greater command over
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, then, this perhaps ideal man has become thoroughly familiar with the
      principles of surgical anatomy, operative surgery, surgical pathology, and
      bacteriology, in addition to the things already mentioned, then, and not
      until then, may he and should he assume to operate for harelip, cleft
      palate, cancer of the tongue, and various other lesions in the parts about
      the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I<span class="pagenum">339</span><a name="link339" id="link339"></a> wish
      I could say and demonstrate more to impress upon you the important bearing
      of modern surgical pathology to dentistry. Perhaps I can give you no
      better illustrations than you can see in the studies and writings of Prof.
      W. D. Miller, of Berlin, of whom I am proud to say that he is an American,
      and that he is the only American occupying a professorship in a German
      university. In his studies on the causes of dental caries and upon the
      bacteria of the mouth he has identified and named nearly a hundred species
      of the bacteria, many of which he has shown to be the active causes of
      dental decay. He has done, then, for dental pathology in this direction
      what other eminent observers have done for the processes of suppuration
      and ulceration in other textures and tissues, and has helped to show that
      they are all evidences of pernicious germ activity. By his researches,
      also, upon inflammation in elephant-tusks, and the results of injury,
      mainly by bullet wounds, he has shown us that the phenomena attending
      these changes in dental tissues are practically identical with those in
      bone. His researches have done very much to explain the pathology of that
      common disease, pyorrhoea alveolaris, which is known to be but one
      expression of local infection, while the possibility of migration of
      infectious organisms and of metastatic lesions in other parts of the body,
      having their origin in infectious disease in or near the teeth, has been
      brilliantly demonstrated by his interpretation of well-known clinical
      facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      That American dentists are most highly regarded abroad is more than a
      matter of every-day knowledge. It has got to be so now that a foreigner
      will purchase instruments of American make, and then advertise himself as
      an American dentist for the purpose of getting business,&mdash;a purpose
      in which, as a rule, he is quite successful. But let me stop here to do
      honor to another American dentist who is more highly honored abroad than
      one ever can be at home, and of whom it might be said, perhaps, that<span
      class="pagenum">340</span><a name="link340" id="link340"></a> he has had
      more friends among the royalty and nobility of Europe than any other man
      of his time. This is Dr. Evans, who has lived for years in Paris, who was
      the personal friend of Napoleon III and the trusted guide and companion of
      the Empress Eugenie when she fled from Paris. While it may be said of him
      that the qualities that made him so universally popular were personal
      qualities, rather than professional knowledge, it must be said in reply
      that it was his eminent professional attainment which first brought him
      such influential friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      But time presses, and I want, before closing, to say a little about
      dentistry in America. It was about 1835 that Dr. Harris, then residing in
      Baltimore, though born near Syracuse, conceived the modern idea of the
      scope and practice of dentistry. He was ambitious to put the dentists of
      his time upon a higher professional level, and to make of dentistry a
      specialty in medicine. He applied to various medical schools to found
      dental chairs, and to teach oral pathology along with dental mechanics, as
      one of the branches of medicine, the graduating degree to be M.D., as with
      other medical specialties. But the men of his time were so short-sighted
      and of such constricted mental calibre, and the dentists were so
      uneducated, that the Baltimore schools declined. He therefore established
      a separate school, being forced to take this step. This school was the
      Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, established in 1839,&mdash;the first
      in any country. The dentistry of that day was crude, and its teaching was
      comparatively inefficient. It was not until six years later that the next,
      the Cincinnati College of Dental Surgery was organized,&mdash;in 1845.
      Then, in time, followed Philadelphia. But all these colleges were separate
      institutions, teaching only those branches which it was held necessary
      that a <i>dentist</i> should know and having very little of medicine in
      their curriculum. They conferred the degree of D.D.S.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1868 Harvard University did what she ought to have<span class="pagenum">341</span><a
      name="link341" id="link341"></a> done at the outset. She opened a dental
      department and began the teaching of dentistry as a branch of medicine,
      establishing therefor a separate degree,&mdash;D.M.D.,&mdash;<i>Den-tarioe
      Meclicince</i> Doctor. In 1874 the University of Michigan established a
      dental department, and a little later the University of Pennsylvania did
      the same. These university schools gave an immensely widened scope to the
      study, which was made broader with each succeeding year.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are now forty-five dental colleges in the United States. Forty of
      these are members of the National Association of Dental Faculties,
      organized for the purpose of securing uniformity in teaching and in
      graduating men. Membership in this association is a certificate of high
      standing and of comprehensive advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year (1894) the number of students in dental colleges was 4979, while
      the number of graduates was 1208. At present nearly all the States have
      legislation governing the practice of dentistry, and often more strict
      than that regulating the practice of medicine. In New York the law places
      dentistry on precisely the same plane as medicine,&mdash;prescribes the
      same qualifications for matriculation, the same length of study, exactions
      for graduation, examination, etc. In other words, the law is quite as
      strict regarding admission to dental colleges as to medical. After 1897 at
      least a full high-school course will be demanded for matriculation, and
      from now on we may look forward to having a really educated dental
      profession.
